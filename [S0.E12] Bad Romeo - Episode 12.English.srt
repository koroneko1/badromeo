1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,400
THIS FICTIONAL SERIES IS INTENDED
FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY

2
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,159
I know everything now!

3
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,680
I know why he accuses me of killing him.

4
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:51,080
I'll give you
one last chance to redeem yourself.

5
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,280
Ruin Saikhim's wedding.

6
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,960
I'm going to swindle Gaogla.

7
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,960
I'll have Saikhim
take marital property from him.

8
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,719
Are we still friends?

9
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,000
Why did you betray me like this?

10
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,639
I'm marrying Tan.

11
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,520
I won't let this
get in the way of our marriage.

12
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,879
I wanna settle the divorce.

13
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,439
You said you wanted nothing,

14
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,520
but now, you want hundreds of millions?

15
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,639
Just one night

16
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,319
in exchange for a lifetime with him.
Isn't it worth it?

17
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,120
He's married. He has a wife.

18
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,039
They were together last night.

19
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,000
Before becoming someone else's wife,
make it up to me.

20
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,199
How should I do that?

21
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,400
Just tell me.

22
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,120
Two kinds of people are
friends with their ex.

23
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,599
The first kind

24
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,319
never loved their ex in the first place.

25
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:32,759
The other kind

26
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,919
are still in love.

27
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,080
Does someone really live here?

28
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,759
Yeah, the owner wants to redecorate it.

29
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,800
I'd like you to clean it first.

30
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,159
All right.

31
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,560
I saw those images when I closed my eyes.

32
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:26,399
When I was awake, I couldn't tell
what was real and what was nightmares.

33
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,399
For years now,
I've been scared to fall asleep

34
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,360
and never wake up again.

35
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,079
Try living my life,

36
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,519
or go through half what I've been through!

37
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,800
MR. CARL, LORAZEPAM (25MG)

38
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,160
Please put these clothes
in the washing machine.

39
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,439
And then

40
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,879
please bring them back and iron them.

41
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,639
-Sure.
-Thank you.

42
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,600
Back already?

43
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,759
Is anyone here?

44
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,480
Is someone here?

45
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
Who is here?

46
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,120
You don't like her,
but you let her come and go around here.

47
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,079
Quite a love-hate relationship.

48
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,759
She's not doing it for free.
She's doing it to redeem herself.

49
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,319
Right, so it's not for free.
Is this punishment for her infidelity?

50
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:17,120
Whoa, what is up with this couple?

51
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,639
You're talking crap.

52
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,439
Right, you must feel so good
about getting back at her.

53
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:24,920
Wow, look how you're trying to stop her
from getting remarried.

54
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,519
My darling Gla!

55
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
In what way do I look
like I'm still in love?

56
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,680
You're like

57
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,159
fans of chains, whips, and handcuffs.

58
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,559
One of you loves torture,
and the other loves pain or something,

59
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:41,240
letting the other punish them.

60
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,000
Stop talking nonsense. I'm not a psycho.

61
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,840
I'm kidding. Chill out.

62
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,159
-And what's that?
-This?

63
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
I don't know. I saw it sitting over there.

64
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,399
Did Khim buy you this?

65
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,120
That's cheating.

66
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,799
Who asked you to use these fragrances?

67
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,159
They smell nice.

68
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,440
Wash them again.
And don't use fabric softener.

69
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:25,840
Masculine people

70
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,960
don't like soft things, do they?

71
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,600
And throw out this machine.

72
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,279
What? Don't say you don't like technology.

73
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,799
You said you'd give up your time
to make it up to me.

74
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,840
But this machine saves time.

75
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,480
Throwing money at the problem is cheating.

76
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
Then who would clean--

77
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,799
I could discount the time
that it does your job for you.

78
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,759
When you're here, make an effort.

79
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,399
Don't just phone it in.
You have to live and breathe me.

80
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,759
Think of me when you wake up
and when you go to sleep.

81
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,480
That's what counts as compensation.
If you can't do that, don't bother coming.

82
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,840
Nothing you do can make it up to me!

83
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,480
You promised me

84
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,399
you'd divorce me if I could stand this.

85
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,279
Why are you wasting power
on this stupid fridge?

86
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,840
Do you let your hotel guests
starve to death like this?

87
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,159
Fill the fridge before I get home.
I'll reimburse you.

88
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:46,759
Wait.

89
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,440
Keep these keys.

90
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,440
Come and go without bothering me.

91
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,840
You'd better avoid me.

92
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:29,360
Khim! There you are.
Have you been waiting long?

93
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,799
Tan.

94
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,279
How come you got here so fast?

95
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,039
Whoa, look at all this.
Why are you buying so many things?

96
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,639
I thought you liked dark roast.

97
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:51,480
Well, I just wanted to try
a different flavor.

98
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:56,080
Okay, let's buy some things
and take them home.

99
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,519
Come on.

100
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,720
Since you're free now,
use this time to prepare to be my bride.

101
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,200
Come on.

102
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,799
So that means we have less than a day left
to spend together before you fly again.

103
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,519
It's no trouble.

104
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,000
Of course I'll see you off.

105
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,519
I'll call you back.

106
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,799
I came to put your stuff away.

107
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,919
This is for your breakfast.

108
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:49,080
Tissues, shampoo, and toothpaste.

109
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,480
That's my stuff. You don't have to pay.

110
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,639
The razor too?

111
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,679
You shopped for your partner
during work hours?

112
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,120
You were gone five hours.
You shopped for him for three hours.

113
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,919
You only need two hours
to buy crap for the fridge.

114
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,720
In a day, how many minutes
do you dedicate to me?

115
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,799
I have five months till my wedding.

116
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,159
That's all I can give you.

117
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,480
Then we go into extra time.

118
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,679
Marry him, then divorce me.

119
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,960
It's a sharing society.

120
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:27,120
We can share everything, even wives.

121
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,559
I'd like to try it.

122
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,559
You're so good at sneaking around.

123
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,320
This is why

124
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,519
I said it'd never work out for us anyway!

125
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,279
You're a brute.

126
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,200
I'm so lucky that I managed to get away
from someone like you!

127
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,559
I'll clean it up in the morning.
Don't eat it all up by accident.

128
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,320
Give me back
the time that you spent with other men.

129
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,840
Try living and breathing me.

130
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,720
When you're here, make an effort.

131
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,240
Don't just phone it in.

132
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,960
You have to live and breathe me.

133
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:52,799
Think of me when you wake up
and when you go to sleep.

134
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,519
That's what counts as compensation.
If you can't do that, don't bother coming.

135
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,879
Nothing you do can make it up to me!

136
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,680
Carl's very sensitive about kids.

137
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:11,640
Whenever he sees kids,

138
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,960
he always helps them or protects them.

139
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,880
It's like he wants to be a dad
to the kids who are still here.

140
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,119
Daydreaming, are you?

141
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:32,680
No.

142
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:33,920
Had enough yet?

143
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:37,200
-What?
-I just prayed for you.

144
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,240
Had enough blessings?

145
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,039
The alms bowl isn't full yet.
The novice will go hungry.

146
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,000
Go fill his bowl over there.

147
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:55,039
If you do a charitable deed,
you can go home early today.

148
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,440
What's going on?
Why is there so much food?

149
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,839
My dear Carl.

150
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,519
A food tour group booked lunch here today.

151
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:48,759
But their plane happened to get delayed,

152
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:51,319
so they canceled at the last minute.

153
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,920
These days, convenience isn't the focus
of our competitive strategy.

154
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,039
Guests' satisfaction may depend on
communication instead.

155
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:02,359
YOU HAVE ONE NEW MESSAGE

156
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,960
Our customer service system should cover
our guests throughout their trip,

157
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,880
even while they're out sightseeing.

158
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,559
Please excuse me.

159
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,839
What? I'm in a meeting.

160
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,960
Can't you bring the meeting here?

161
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,720
Get someone else to do it.

162
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:37,039
If you help me out over here,

163
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,960
I'll give you a day off.

164
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,559
Stay there. I'm on my way.

165
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,799
It worked!

166
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,480
-We did it.
-We don't have to throw it out.

167
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,720
It's lunchtime.

168
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:57,039
May I suggest we take this meeting
off-site for the afternoon?

169
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:59,440
We haven't done
team-building activities lately.

170
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,799
Please pack up your things
and let's get a change of scenery.

171
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:05,359
Let's go.

172
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,000
Please go ahead.

173
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:17,960
Khim.

174
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,039
Are you on a break?

175
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,960
Yes. What are you doing here?

176
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,759
Did you forget?
We have a meeting with the catering team.

177
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,839
Right.

178
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,039
She cheated again.

179
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,759
Compensation?

180
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,920
He wants girlfriend duties
as compensation?

181
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,440
If I can manage this,
he'll agree to divorce me.

182
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:06,440
Hey. Does this count as two-timing?

183
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:09,039
He's obviously making you cheat on Tan.

184
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:14,039
That's why I need your help.
I know you're good at this stuff.

185
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:17,319
Whoa… are you calling me two-faced?

186
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,079
That really hurts.

187
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,799
-What?
-Do you want to make it up to me?

188
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,119
Very much!

189
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,440
In that case,

190
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:30,640
please take care of Tan for me.

191
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:37,359
But… so Gla isn't just stalling
because he doesn't want a divorce?

192
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,079
Don't worry.

193
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:41,640
Time won't make us love each other more.

194
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,759
I thought you wanted a day off.

195
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:51,880
So what is this?

196
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,920
I know how to do my job.

197
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,599
Stop micromanaging me.

198
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,160
Yes.

199
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,880
-Hello.
-Well, hello there!

200
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,880
Well, we're so lucky
that you and your team are free today.

201
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,279
I happened to be looking for
a team activity for us.

202
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,359
I see.

203
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,480
At first,

204
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:23,680
Madame and I thought that today,
no one would come to taste this after all.

205
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,839
All right, let's work together here.

206
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,640
I'm almost done here.

207
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,200
I'll be there soon.

208
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:40,000
Did you talk to your wife?

209
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,519
I haven't seen her yet.
Is something wrong, Claire?

210
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,720
I just wonder how you'll settle things
if you keep avoiding each other.

211
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,720
I'll call her back soon.

212
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,599
Should I talk to her for you?
Speaking woman to woman might be easier.

213
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,200
Save that as a last resort.
I'll do it my way first.

214
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,160
You have until I get back.

215
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,680
If you're not divorced by then,

216
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,880
you'll never see me again.

217
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,920
He didn't admit it, did he,

218
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:23,079
that he meant to trick you?

219
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,400
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

220
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:36,279
He married that woman
because he got her pregnant.

221
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:41,039
She was just a spoiled brat
who met him in a dating app.

222
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,559
He agreed to marry her
to look after the baby.

223
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,079
They see each other all the time
but pretend there's nothing between them.

224
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:58,960
This is Carl.

225
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,200
Carl?

226
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:02,160
Carl Raman. He's half Thai, half Kazakh.

227
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,519
His name comes from his Thai name, Gaogla.

228
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:09,000
It's nice to meet you… Carl.

229
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,759
Are you married?

230
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:16,200
Is this your wife's lipstick?

231
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:17,359
Who told you that?

232
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,839
Your eyes did.

233
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,200
How could you hide
such a big secret from me?

234
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,519
You made me the other woman.

235
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,160
Why did you do this to me?

236
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,400
What do they think I am?

237
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,200
Miss Khim is getting married. Why…

238
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,119
Maybe there won't be a wedding

239
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,599
if they change their minds
and get back together.

240
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,519
Back then,

241
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:44,680
if I'd known about the certificate,

242
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,519
I could have warned you long ago.

243
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:49,599
So are they still in love?

244
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,079
She might keep him to herself
so you can't have him.

245
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,640
Who knows?

246
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,079
They might be together right now.

247
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,759
Watch that other side too. All right.

248
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,000
Miss Claire, what is it?

249
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,880
I haven't seen her yet.
Is something wrong, Claire?

250
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:31,920
I gave Carl an ultimatum.
If he doesn't get divorced,

251
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,559
I'll dump him.

252
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:38,119
-Excuse me.
-Yes, all right.

253
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,799
Did he promise to get divorced?

254
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,359
If that woman still has hope,
she won't let him go so easily.

255
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:48,519
People shouldn't hold on
to those they no longer love.

256
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,160
If that woman's so selfish,
what's her heart made of?

257
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,759
I hope you do get what you want.

258
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:06,079
I know this man means a lot to you.

259
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,960
And you're great for each other.

260
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,799
I hope Carl means what he says.

261
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:16,119
I don't want to be stupid anymore.

262
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,839
If you get a chance,
please talk some sense into him.

263
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,000
Maybe

264
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:24,279
this will show us his true colors.

265
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,440
We'll see for certain

266
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,920
if this man is worth loving or not.

267
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,359
What's going on?

268
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,559
Well! Miss Khim?

269
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,599
The stove is ready.

270
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:05,160
Miss Khim said there's an organizer
coming to prepare the whole wedding.

271
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,599
There is? But she didn't tell me that.

272
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:12,480
It's me. I'm your wedding planner.

273
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,119
Where are you up to?

274
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:15,920
-You?
-Yeah.

275
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,200
Khim said I could call the shots

276
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:20,839
because the two of us have the same taste.

277
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,039
We like the same things.

278
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,680
-We can change this, right?
-Hey.

279
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,079
Are you sure Khim said that?

280
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,839
We need to talk.

281
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:44,680
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

282
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,000
Are you up to no good?

283
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,119
I'm her maid of honor,
and I'm organizing the wedding.

284
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,079
It's not unusual.

285
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:54,440
Then you'd better truly be
the maid of honor and no more.

286
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,519
What?

287
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,839
Are you afraid
I'll replace the bride myself?

288
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,279
I'm just afraid you'll ruin our wedding.

289
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,680
I don't trust you.

290
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,799
What about you?
Your dad doesn't want you to marry her.

291
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:14,319
You didn't tell her.

292
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,000
The one who will ruin the wedding

293
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,319
is you alone.

294
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,440
If you keep running away from trouble,

295
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:24,079
it will only hurt Khim.

296
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:32,359
MAMA SAJEE

297
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,079
Yes, Mama?

298
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,759
Officer, I want to report an assault.
That bitch slapped me!

299
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:44,119
-Yes, ma'am.
-I won't let this go. I'll come after you!

300
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,079
Mama! I'm sorry.
Did I keep you waiting long?

301
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,160
I was worried I'd have to stay overnight.

302
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,640
And are you hurt at all?

303
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,359
Yes, emotionally!

304
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,799
They ganged up on me!

305
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,359
Right. Give me a second, okay?

306
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,319
Give them hell!

307
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,359
Officer? I'm bailing out this woman.

308
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,839
Sure.

309
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,799
Out there,

310
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,680
don't seduce anyone's husband again!

311
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,720
Who's seducing whom?

312
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:13,559
I'm the victim here.
Your husband tried to assault me!

313
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,519
No, you're the one who seduced him!

314
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:19,440
Do you own a salon or a brothel?
Why do you offer massages?

315
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,400
I just massaged his neck!
Your perverted husband got carried away!

316
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,160
My husband is religious!

317
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,880
He's not a desperate single mom like you!

318
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,599
We're getting fined anyway.

319
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,920
I'll slap her again!

320
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,039
-Ma'am, don't!
-Mama, back off!

321
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:36,880
Let go. Please! That's enough!

322
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,799
Let go, Mama!

323
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,119
Don't fight at the station. Calm down.

324
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,440
-Had enough? Come at me!
-What the hell?

325
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:44,160
-I trashed your salon!
-Enough, Mama!

326
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,160
Look at her!
She started it! This isn't over!

327
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,400
-Enough.
-Calm down.

328
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,920
If Lita knew,
she'd make me close my salon.

329
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,799
She's very sensitive to shame.

330
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,920
Mama, I don't think
you could open it now anyway.

331
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,799
Hey!

332
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,279
Mama, watch out!

333
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:26,920
That was close.

334
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,359
Blood!

335
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,920
Does it hurt?

336
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,160
I'm all right.

337
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,960
Thank you. I'll patch this up for now,
then I'll get someone to fix it.

338
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,200
Don't worry, dear.

339
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:10,480
You got hurt,
and now you're fixing my house too?

340
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,160
This is nothing.

341
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:16,759
It's risky to hire an unknown contractor
when you're all alone, Mama.

342
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,759
That's true.

343
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,119
I do feel scared.

344
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:29,000
If they can do this to me,
who knows when they'll be back again?

345
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,519
I can stay here with you.

346
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
If I'm here,

347
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:39,440
they won't dare try to hurt you.

348
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,200
You'd do that?

349
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,839
If there were a man in this house,

350
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,119
I'd feel much safer.

351
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,359
Thank you, sweetie.

352
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,519
Sure.

353
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:14,519
Oh dear. Lita is calling.

354
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:17,799
Don't let her know we're together.

355
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:22,160
She'd be so embarrassed if she knew
I got mixed up with a jealous wife.

356
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:24,599
All right.

357
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,319
Hello?

358
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,720
How are you, my superstar?

359
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,960
Don't worry about me, honey.

360
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,200
I have so many clients.

361
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,079
MS. LITA THONGMA

362
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:57,960
You can go now.

363
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,440
Remember what I asked?

364
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,920
When you return, I must be divorced.

365
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,039
You're always decisive at work.

366
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,599
If you really want to get divorced,

367
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,440
who can stop you?

368
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,000
I'll do my best.

369
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,839
If you don't act fast,
it means you don't think I'm important.

370
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,359
You have to respect me more.

371
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,799
If you're over a woman,
you have to sever all ties.

372
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:25,599
I'll take care of everything.

373
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,400
Don't worry too much.

374
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,359
I hope this isn't goodbye forever.

375
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:36,519
Good luck.

376
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,559
The car's over there.

377
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,800
-A car's tailing us.
-Whose car is it?

378
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,920
You didn't notice
when it started tailing us?

379
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,199
So what should we do?

380
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,360
Turn right here.

381
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,719
Just turn right.

382
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:45,840
Are they still behind us?

383
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:51,280
If they want to find fault with you,
they don't need to follow your car.

384
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,400
To find out where you go,

385
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,599
they only need to follow your GPS,
and they'll know all about you.

386
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,840
Do you see this?

387
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:06,519
You even dropped a pin on my garage.

388
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,599
No matter when you visit,

389
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:09,920
the whole world will know.

390
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,519
Seriously?

391
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,880
I always sleep in a different place

392
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,639
so that no one can find me.

393
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,159
But you can't keep a secret.

394
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:25,000
Do you know
how dangerous this information is,

395
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:26,960
especially when I work in IT?

396
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,719
I've never had to live in hiding.

397
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,639
I wouldn't know.

398
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:32,840
You gotta be more careful
when two-timing men.

399
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,559
You're new at being a hot mess.

400
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,440
You'll learn soon.

401
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:48,840
We need to change cars.

402
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:52,360
Park it at the garage.

403
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,880
I'll swap them back after work.

404
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,440
Don't wanna get caught cheating?

405
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:59,960
Well, your workout clothes are in the car.

406
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,599
You're joined at the hip
but insist no feelings are involved?

407
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,039
I like the card design Lita suggested.

408
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,119
Yes, let's go with that, Tan.
Are you okay with that?

409
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:34,559
Right.

410
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,760
Sure.

411
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,239
Actually…

412
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,679
You can send it straight to the printers.
I don't have any problems with it.

413
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,360
Anyway, let's update each other later.

414
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:59,039
Is my drink ready, sir?

415
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,400
What a short run.

416
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:08,039
Isn't it a workout?

417
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,239
My earring fell off during my run.

418
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,920
It must be here somewhere.

419
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,119
Well, help me find it.

420
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,920
Around here?

421
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:33,039
Hey!

422
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,599
Right there.

423
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,599
Does it taste nice?

424
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,480
Refreshing, right?

425
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,320
Is it nice and cold?

426
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,280
Serves you right.
Karma works fast, doesn't it?

427
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,960
I ordered a sports drink.
I can't help that he heard "salt drink."

428
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:30,639
It's okay. We're even.

429
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,159
Wait!

430
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,719
What you did to me isn't the same
as what I did to you.

431
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,239
My clothes are wet.

432
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:40,760
I don't wear earrings.

433
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,440
If you cared,
you'd know something wasn't right.

434
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,000
Who'd know that much about your earlobes?
I'm not that nosy a person.

435
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,159
Remember all the details next time.

436
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,159
Why do we have to stop by?

437
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,239
You ordered these, sir?

438
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,480
-Yes.
-Here you go.

439
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:06,440
-Here's what I owe.
-All good?

440
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:07,360
Yes.

441
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,360
Get changed.

442
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,079
Why do I have to get changed?
You just want me to drive, don't you?

443
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:19,039
I want you to be my secretary.
Don't make me look bad.

444
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:27,679
Remember the details.

445
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,280
When we care,

446
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,440
we remember every detail, even underwear.

447
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:42,360
I'm finished.

448
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,800
You said this was a work meeting.

449
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,320
We're about to go to it.

450
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,400
What are you doing?

451
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:24,199
Aside from food tours,
herbal liquor bar tours

452
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,039
have been requested by lots of people too.

453
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:31,159
Take a seat.

454
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,400
You're gonna show Westerners this stuff?

455
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,239
Westerners don't just love
royal Thai cuisine alone.

456
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,719
They want to see commoner culture too.

457
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,519
I wanna see what women may think of it
so I want you to try this out.

458
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,760
Hey! Are you nuts?

459
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:00,679
Don't try anything!

460
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,679
All these people could see, you nutjob!

461
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,320
Now you're a prude?

462
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,119
As if I really wanna hug you.

463
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:42,480
Are you okay?

464
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,880
Give me the keys.

465
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,039
You're okay, aren't you?

466
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:55,480
I'm okay.

467
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,880
You came here as my driver.
Now you're my boss, ma'am?

468
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,679
Well, that fits all right, doesn't it?

469
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,119
If you didn't want it,
I'd give it to a hippo.

470
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,000
All these clothes

471
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:35,119
are secondhand items
that Lita sold online as a student.

472
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,840
Look at this.

473
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,000
She sold them and modeled them herself.

474
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,000
Look at that.

475
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:46,800
I wanted her to know how to earn money
so she wouldn't become a snob

476
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,000
like the kids at her fancy school.

477
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:51,679
Look. Khim helped her sell things too.

478
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:56,360
Khim is such a good girl.
She treats Lita like an equal.

479
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,599
She was basically the only kid
who was friends with Lita.

480
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:01,679
Without that family,

481
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,760
Lita could never have had
such an education.

482
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,000
-Ma'am, don't!
-Mama, back off!

483
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:29,920
Break them up!

484
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,840
Mom!

485
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:42,360
Mom!

486
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,920
Why didn't you tell me this happened?
Why did you keep it from me?

487
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,719
It's nothing, honey. I can handle it.

488
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,000
Calm down, sweetie.

489
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,079
Please calm down.

490
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,679
If Berm hadn't sent me the video,
I'd never have known you got attacked!

491
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,800
But I'm all right now, aren't I?
Please calm down, sweetie.

492
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,199
And whose is this?

493
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,679
Who are you sleeping with now?

494
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,679
Well, Tanthai brought money
to bail me out.

495
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,719
-Mom!
-He said he wouldn't tell anyone, honey!

496
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,039
If you're mad at me
for embarrassing you in front of a man,

497
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,719
go ahead and be mad at me!

498
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,960
But at that moment,

499
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:37,880
I really didn't know
who else to ask for help!

500
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,519
Me, of course!

501
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:45,679
Your own daughter!

502
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:51,360
How could you think I'd care
more about myself than about you?

503
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,599
I don't care
what anyone thinks of us, Mom.

504
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:02,440
But I won't let anyone hurt you!
How could they hurt you like this?

505
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,719
Don't you worry.

506
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,159
I've survived this long.

507
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,159
I'll keep surviving.

508
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,400
And if I were ashamed,

509
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,000
I wouldn't have given birth to you,
my perpetual troublemaker.

510
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,280
Khim's partner

511
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:55,000
is super nice to me.

512
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,599
He's so nice,
I don't know how I can repay him.

513
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:04,840
If there's anything we can do
for him and Khim,

514
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,119
we have to do it.

515
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:10,719
No matter how good Tanthai is,
he's not the best choice for Saikhim!

516
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,159
Khim must have better than the best!

517
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:14,920
I'm giving you two weeks.

518
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,239
Ruin Saikhim's wedding.

519
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,360
Why are you here?

520
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:55,400
Well,

521
00:46:56,559 --> 00:46:57,400
I…

522
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,000
I heard about Mom,
so I came here right away.

523
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:03,119
What did you just do?

524
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,000
-Did you take a photo of me sleeping?
-No.

525
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:09,000
Delete it right now.

526
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:10,159
I said, delete it.

527
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:12,880
Give me that.

528
00:47:14,679 --> 00:47:16,440
There. You really did take a photo.

529
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:18,519
Why did you do that?

530
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,679
What is this?

531
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:30,159
What does this mean?

532
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,920
When did you take this photo?

533
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,440
I didn't…

534
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:36,519
You're betraying Saikhim again?

535
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,360
Tan.

536
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,800
Listen to me first, Tan.

537
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:50,679
I didn't take those photos.

538
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,679
Then who did?

539
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:54,360
Well…

540
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,880
someone's been watching us.

541
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,199
Are all the photos like that?

542
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:02,719
Shush.

543
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:05,039
Why did you keep those photos?

544
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:07,800
Look, I'm not gonna blackmail you.

545
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:10,000
How can I trust you?

546
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,679
Don't tell me you let me stay tonight…

547
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,039
Don't jump to conclusions, okay?

548
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:16,960
Please?

549
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,639
I promise…

550
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:22,039
no, I swear

551
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:25,840
that Saikhim will never see these photos.

552
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,480
I don't know if I can trust you now.

553
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:32,440
Why do you always have ulterior motives?

554
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,320
I can't tell anymore

555
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,400
who you really are.

556
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,599
Tan!

557
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,000
If you wanna hear the truth,

558
00:48:56,519 --> 00:48:58,000
are you sure you can handle it?

559
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,679
Well…

560
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,599
We're here.

561
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,599
-Khim?
-Yeah.

562
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,440
Wake up.

563
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:02,079
We're here.

564
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,719
But this isn't home!

565
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,000
If I drop you off,

566
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,280
you'll owe me time for the service.

567
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:22,000
I'm leaving now.

568
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,400
I'm leaving. Okay.

569
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,679
Khim.

570
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,119
Hey. Khim.

571
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,360
Wait inside.

572
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,320
You can't drive like this.

573
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,119
Hey, I'm fine.

574
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,039
Can you get me the keys?

575
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,719
I called Khem for you.

576
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,079
He'll drive you home.

577
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,880
Come on. Wait inside.

578
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,760
Come on.

579
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,559
Let's go.

580
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,599
Come on, Khim.

581
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,320
What's wrong?

582
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,159
Cancel the flight. Give me the car keys.

583
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:09,519
Give me the keys!

584
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:12,800
What? Where are you going?

585
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,239
A car's tailing us.

586
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,880
So what should we do?

587
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,480
Turn right here.

588
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,000
Water.

589
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:47,880
Water.

590
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,000
You're still giving orders?

591
00:53:18,519 --> 00:53:19,440
Don't fall asleep.

592
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,800
Have some water.

593
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,360
Drink it properly.

594
00:53:50,199 --> 00:53:51,800
Are you pretending to be drunk?

595
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,119
Hey!

596
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,199
It's so cute.

597
00:54:24,039 --> 00:54:25,400
Did you do it yourself?

598
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:27,039
Can you teach me?

599
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:31,079
You keep saying things are cute,
but you never say you love them.

600
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,559
You have to be even cuter than this.

601
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,679
So you won't love me in this life?

602
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:44,719
You're so sulky.

603
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,280
You're so infuriating.

604
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:56,800
Luckily, I'm good at making up.

605
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:11,039
I've said it so many times.
You just didn't listen.

606
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:27,840
What are you doing?

607
00:56:35,719 --> 00:56:37,280
Aren't you supposed to do this?

608
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,440
No, like this.

609
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:43,239
This way, I can tell

610
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,039
if I can still make your heart race.

611
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,000
Is it loud and clear?

612
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,159
Is it seismic enough?

613
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,159
I can't stop loving you.

614
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,320
I told you.

615
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,159
I'll stop loving you
when I stop breathing.

616
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:31,000
I love you too.

617
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,559
What time is it?

618
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:22,079
Eleven o'clock.

619
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,000
I'm… going home.

620
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:34,519
My car keys.

621
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,599
You can't leave like this.
You're still drunk.

622
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:45,159
I can drive.

623
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:49,480
Hey. Wait.

624
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,039
Khem is on the way.

625
00:59:54,519 --> 00:59:55,960
I… can drive myself.

626
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,679
Where the hell is he?

627
01:00:57,159 --> 01:00:58,280
Hey, stop here!

628
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,039
Hey!

629
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,840
Hey, bro! Something happened!

630
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,280
What is it, Khem?

631
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,639
Your women are fighting!

632
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,599
Turn around and follow them!

633
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,519
Khem!

634
01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:48,400
What?

635
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:02,400
Crap!

636
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:04,599
She wants to kill her?

637
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:07,760
I'm on my way! Keep an eye on them!

638
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:19,519
Help! Please help Miss Khim!

639
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:20,840
What did you do to her?

640
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,199
Please help Miss Khim!

641
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,840
Khim, wake up!

642
01:02:24,679 --> 01:02:27,440
Khim! Bro, call an ambulance!

643
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:30,400
Khim! Wake up, Khim!

644
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,599
-Khim?
-Wake up!

645
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,360
Open your car door!

646
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:35,159
Come on!

647
01:02:38,679 --> 01:02:39,519
Move aside!

648
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:47,880
-Khim!
-Miss Khim?

649
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:48,800
Miss Khim?

650
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:56,639
Move aside!

651
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,599
Bro! Is she dead?

652
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:43,159
Carl.

653
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,400
Bro, stay back! Bro!

654
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:49,760
Stay back! Brace yourself, bro!

655
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
-What do you mean?
-Brace yourself, bro!

656
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,199
-Damn it, let go!
-Khim's not breathing!

657
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,119
No!

658
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:14,840
Khim!

659
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,719
Khim, wake up!

660
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,239
Khim!

661
01:04:27,639 --> 01:04:28,760
This can't be real.

662
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:33,280
This can't be real!

663
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,280
Khim!

664
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,320
No!

665
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,239
This can't be real.

666
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,079
I didn't do this!

667
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,679
Khem!

668
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:50,159
Take Claire away! Go on!

669
01:04:51,079 --> 01:04:52,559
Come here! Get away!

670
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:01,559
Khim!

671
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,159
Khim, wake up!

672
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:10,519
Khim!

673
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:13,239
Can you hear me?

674
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,679
Wake up, Khim!

675
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:18,719
You said you'd use your time
to make it up to me.

676
01:05:20,599 --> 01:05:22,159
Don't run from me like this!

677
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,880
Can you hear me, Khim?

678
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,239
I waited for so long.

679
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,199
You can't leave me like this, Khim!

680
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:31,719
Khim, wake up!

681
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,199
Khim!

682
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:39,840
Khim!

683
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:44,599
Khim, I beg you!

684
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:49,639
Don't leave me, Khim!

685
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,039
Stay with me, Khim!

686
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:25,480
Stop pumping.

687
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:28,880
Her pulse is back.

688
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,400
-Do you know her?
-I'm her husband.

689
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,280
We met by accident.

690
01:06:52,039 --> 01:06:54,119
We know each other
because of our mistakes.

691
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,079
We loved each other
because we had no one left.

692
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:00,800
We broke up
when we loved each other the most.

693
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:06,599
Please be all right.

694
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,360
-Khim!
-Please stay back!

695
01:07:14,199 --> 01:07:17,199
The patient's lungs were bruised
by the impact of the crash.

696
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,679
This could cause respiratory failure.

697
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:23,159
The patient may need to use a ventilator
if she can't breathe on her own.

698
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:30,679
Before becoming someone else's wife,
make it up to me.

699
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,239
If I do this…

700
01:07:34,519 --> 01:07:36,920
you'll sign the divorce papers
and let me go, right?

701
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
You have to sacrifice your time.
You have to be at my beck and call.

702
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:45,800
If you feel nothing when you're with me,
it means we're nothing to each other,

703
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,199
and I'll sign the papers,

704
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,760
and you can go away,
and marry anyone you want.

705
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,320
If it's not what you asked for last night,

706
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:55,840
I can do it.

707
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:02,920
Does it taste nice?

708
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,760
Refreshing, right?

709
01:08:14,119 --> 01:08:15,639
Hey! Are you nuts?

710
01:08:17,479 --> 01:08:18,560
Don't try anything!

711
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,439
All these people could see, you nutjob!

712
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:22,800
Now you're a prude?

713
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:25,600
As if I really wanna hug you.

714
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,479
It's a sharing society.

715
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,880
We can share everything, even wives.

716
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,279
I'd like to try it.

717
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:41,720
You're so good at sneaking around.

718
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:46,119
This is why

719
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,319
I said it'd never work out for us anyway!

720
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,119
You're a brute.

721
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:56,119
I'm so lucky that I managed to get away
from someone like you!

722
01:08:59,079 --> 01:09:01,399
Get up and be mad at me,
hate me, or insult me.

723
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,279
But please be all right.

724
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:07,600
Nurse, we have to move her!
She's not doing so well!

725
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:17,960
Please don't come in.
Family members have to wait out there.

726
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,720
You can't come in yet.

727
01:09:21,239 --> 01:09:22,079
Out, please.

728
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,439
-Please wait out there.
-Okay.

729
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:48,359
Even if we aren't friends,

730
01:09:49,159 --> 01:09:50,840
we don't have to be enemies.

731
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:55,439
We're just strangers
who share some memories.

732
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,680
What do you need?

733
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:11,800
Are you in pain?

734
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:12,800
Are you cold?

735
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:15,119
Are you scared?

736
01:10:27,079 --> 01:10:29,760
Forget it, Khim.
This isn't the time to talk about it.

737
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:32,399
When you're better,
wake up, and we'll talk.

738
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:34,600
Then, no matter what you have to say,

739
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:36,159
I won't stop you.

740
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,960
Bro! How is she?

741
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:52,560
Not good.

742
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,640
-What about Claire?
-I took her to your place.

743
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:57,119
She's still shaken.

744
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,359
If something happens to Saikhim,

745
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:06,079
she could be charged
with manslaughter or murder.

746
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:08,199
Look after Claire.

747
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,119
I'll deal with the case.

748
01:11:11,159 --> 01:11:12,000
Go on.

749
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,640
So you were at the scene, sir?

750
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:19,199
-Yes, sir.
-Tell me the details of the incident.

751
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:28,439
How's my daughter, Doctor?

752
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:30,760
Her blood carbon dioxide level's high.

753
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,520
The oxygen level in her lungs is low.

754
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,640
We have to give her supportive treatment

755
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:37,039
and watch out for lung infections.

756
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,840
The doctor said Miss Khim was lucky
someone performed CPR on her.

757
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,840
That's why she regained consciousness.

758
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:44,640
What caused this accident?

759
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:47,600
The patient may have driven
while she was intoxicated.

760
01:11:49,079 --> 01:11:50,119
She was drunk?

761
01:11:50,199 --> 01:11:52,800
But that's impossible.
Khim's so careful about that.

762
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:54,880
For tonight,

763
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,119
we'll observe her in the ICU.

764
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:58,199
If necessary,

765
01:11:58,279 --> 01:11:59,800
we'll intubate her,

766
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,159
just like I told her husband.

767
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:04,960
Husband?

768
01:12:05,039 --> 01:12:06,119
Wait.

769
01:12:06,199 --> 01:12:07,439
Doctor, don't tell me

770
01:12:08,439 --> 01:12:10,000
the person who brought Saikhim is…

771
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:12,319
I had him sign this informed consent form.

772
01:12:12,399 --> 01:12:14,760
You can talk about it as a family.

773
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,359
Please excuse me.

774
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:19,800
Who does he mean?

775
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,279
CARL RAMAN, THE PATIENT'S HUSBAND

776
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:30,640
That's Mr. Carl.
Did the doctor misunderstand something?

777
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:31,920
You might as well know.

778
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:35,279
Saikhim and Carl were married.

779
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:39,560
But if they were together last night,
maybe "were" is the wrong word.

780
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:40,920
What does this mean?

781
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,640
It means they're still a married couple!

782
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:45,880
And that makes you an adulterer!

783
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:46,880
Now you know!

784
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:04,680
I thought you went home.

785
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,840
Your wife is Miss Khim?

786
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
If I weren't here,
I wouldn't have found out.

787
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,640
And you brought her here last night.

788
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:18,439
Today, I meant to confront Miss Khim
about her lie, that's all.

789
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,319
You know you almost killed her?

790
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:23,079
I didn't want it to end up like this!

791
01:13:23,159 --> 01:13:25,000
The car suddenly rushed forward!

792
01:13:25,079 --> 01:13:26,479
I may be angry,

793
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,119
but I wouldn't kill someone!

794
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:30,520
I know. I'm not blaming you.

795
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,119
I minded my own business.

796
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:35,640
How did I get mixed up in this mess?

797
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:36,640
Calm down.

798
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:37,800
Let go!

799
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:41,600
I didn't do it!

800
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,039
Why?

801
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:44,960
Claire.

802
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:50,159
If anyone should be blamed, it's me.

803
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,720
I alone should face the consequences.

804
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,199
Seven years ago,
Miss Khim ran off with that man.

805
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:04,000
He wasn't Carl back then.

806
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:05,960
He was just a poor young man

807
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:07,840
called Gaogla.

808
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:08,880
Gaogla?

809
01:14:09,399 --> 01:14:10,960
Remember the yacht incident?

810
01:14:12,439 --> 01:14:14,479
The man who snuck onto your yacht…

811
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:17,039
Have you seen the guy who came with us?

812
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:18,560
Not lately, no.

813
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,439
He followed us on purpose.
He might be a con man.

814
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:22,760
Really?

815
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:25,520
She got pregnant by accident,

816
01:14:26,199 --> 01:14:28,199
so Mr. Seen disowned her for a while.

817
01:14:28,279 --> 01:14:30,239
The relationship didn't last long.

818
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:31,479
Miss Khim miscarried,

819
01:14:32,279 --> 01:14:33,600
Gaogla died in prison,

820
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:36,159
and we thought it was all over.

821
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:37,920
But he survived.

822
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:42,800
Miss Khim recently found out
that Gaogla and Carl are the same person.

823
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:50,279
Eventually, the dark side had to come out.
You're a coward face to face.

824
01:14:50,359 --> 01:14:51,840
Behind my back, you're so brave.

825
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,560
She's good at killing people
who feel sorry for her.

826
01:14:55,399 --> 01:14:56,439
What do you mean?

827
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,359
Wait and see.

828
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:00,760
I'll drag your lies and deceit
out into the light.

829
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,520
And you'll see that this woman

830
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,239
is so evil on the inside.

831
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:05,439
One day,

832
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,680
you'll know the taste
of a lover's betrayal.

833
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,640
They're getting divorced,
but marital property is still an issue.

834
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,920
When Miss Khim agreed to marry you,

835
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,560
she didn't know
that she was still married.

836
01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:57,760
If something happens to you,

837
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,720
I'll get revenge in your next life.

838
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,000
How is Khim?

839
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,520
Still unconscious.

840
01:16:30,199 --> 01:16:31,880
Has the doctor visited her?

841
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,520
Why is Khim so unlucky lately?

842
01:16:43,239 --> 01:16:44,560
You should ask Gla.

843
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,760
So last night, you kept me close

844
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,920
to let Khim cheat on me
with her ex-husband?

845
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,199
How many more secrets
are you hiding from me?

846
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,199
You knew Khim was with him,

847
01:17:01,279 --> 01:17:02,760
but you both kept it from me?

848
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:05,520
Well, so what?
Will her secret make you leave her?

849
01:17:06,119 --> 01:17:07,520
What choices do I have?

850
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:11,039
I'd be stupid to marry her.
You'll call me small-minded if I dump her.

851
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:12,920
Who's the selfish one?

852
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,079
Which of us?

853
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:15,079
Why do you ask?

854
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:17,279
Do you want her to die?

855
01:17:18,319 --> 01:17:19,880
What a perfect ending for you.

856
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:23,279
You'll get sympathy,
and you don't have to pretend to be nice.

857
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,039
You want that ending?

858
01:17:27,159 --> 01:17:28,560
"Nothing else matters now."

859
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,760
"I just want Khim to wake up."

860
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,720
If you really love her,
aren't those the words

861
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,319
that you should say now?

862
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,359
I beg you, Tan.

863
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,239
When she wakes up, don't be cruel to her,

864
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,800
because if she knew, she'd be so hurt

865
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,760
that you're not as nice as she thought.

866
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:56,800
When we show our true selves,
and someone can stand us at our worst,

867
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,560
and they don't want to run away,
and they're not repulsed,

868
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,439
no matter how awful we are,

869
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,039
if someone

870
01:18:03,119 --> 01:18:06,079
loves us for who we are like that,
then that's called love!

871
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:10,199
You have to ask yourself
if you can do that for Khim yet.

872
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:16,600
Sir, Miss Saikhim is awake now.

873
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:18,239
Family members can see her now.

874
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:29,439
The doctor said
her oxygen level is back to normal now.

875
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:33,000
We'll move her to a special ward
where she can recover.

876
01:18:33,079 --> 01:18:34,039
Thank you.

877
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:36,800
Khim?

878
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:39,039
Where does it hurt?

879
01:18:41,079 --> 01:18:44,359
I don't even know how I got here.

880
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:46,199
I only know

881
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,000
I was driving, and I blacked out.

882
01:18:55,279 --> 01:18:57,000
You went drinking with Carl.

883
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,199
Rest up before the divorce.

884
01:19:03,279 --> 01:19:04,880
I hope you survive long enough.

885
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:08,840
I'm sorry…

886
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:11,359
Get well soon.

887
01:19:11,439 --> 01:19:12,720
Don't worry about me.

888
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,199
As for the wedding,

889
01:19:14,279 --> 01:19:15,880
let's talk about it later.

890
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:30,920
Based on this dashcam footage,
it's obvious that they tailgated her!

891
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,119
They wanted to kill her.

892
01:19:34,199 --> 01:19:35,880
He wants his wife's fortune.

893
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:39,560
But the street CCTV shows
that they didn't hit her car.

894
01:19:40,439 --> 01:19:42,319
And Gaogla was the one who helped her.

895
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:43,840
Helped to hurt her!

896
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:46,960
They conspired to do this.

897
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:47,920
Fortunately,

898
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:51,319
Khim has fate on her side and survived.

899
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,159
Throw everything at them.

900
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,920
If there's proof
that he tried to kill her,

901
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,359
or that his girlfriend did,
one of them must be charged.

902
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:04,880
I'd love to know

903
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,239
if he'd let a woman take the fall for him.

904
01:20:07,319 --> 01:20:11,760
But if there's a scandal,
Miss Khim's wedding could be ruined.

905
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,199
Well, let it be ruined!

906
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,600
As long as Gla is still around,

907
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:18,840
do you think he'd let Khim be happy?

908
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:28,119
Your father suspects
this wasn't an accident.

909
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:34,319
I can't remember
if there was a car following me.

910
01:20:34,399 --> 01:20:35,479
I only remember

911
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:40,319
feeling sleepy the whole time,
like I was gonna black out.

912
01:20:40,399 --> 01:20:43,239
Miss Khim, don't you remember
a car cutting in front of you?

913
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:47,039
I really can't put the pieces together.

914
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:49,880
The police are questioning them.

915
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:53,039
We have a witness
who saw that it was Miss Claire.

916
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,920
Your father thinks this incident

917
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,119
can be used to file for divorce.

918
01:21:03,479 --> 01:21:05,560
So they do wanna press charges.

919
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:06,800
What should I do?

920
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:09,399
Do I need a lawyer?

921
01:21:09,479 --> 01:21:12,359
Don't worry. I'll talk to them for you.

922
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:13,720
Don't forget.

923
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,079
Don't put her reputation at risk like this

924
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:18,159
'cause if people knew
adultery was the cause,

925
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,159
it could end her career.

926
01:21:21,079 --> 01:21:22,039
Come on.

927
01:21:29,279 --> 01:21:30,560
They waited for this moment.

928
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:33,079
They'll use this case to get back at us.

929
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:56,720
How are you?

930
01:21:59,479 --> 01:22:00,560
It still aches.

931
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:02,880
Claire knows we were together.

932
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,239
She tailgated you yesterday.

933
01:22:05,319 --> 01:22:06,960
She may have gone too far.

934
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,960
She's sorry.

935
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,479
She didn't think it'd get this violent.

936
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:15,680
I know about the case
the police are putting together.

937
01:22:18,079 --> 01:22:19,479
That's why you're here, right?

938
01:22:20,399 --> 01:22:21,960
Can you leave Claire out of it?

939
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:24,079
What do you mean?

940
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:28,520
If you don't accuse her,
I'll agree to the divorce right away.

941
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,920
I'll end it with you unconditionally.

942
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:35,840
I won't demand anything of you.

943
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:38,119
No marital property.

944
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,640
No time.

945
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:42,840
I won't rehash our past.

946
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,720
You can forget we loved each other.

947
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,159
I just want you to leave Claire alone.

948
01:22:55,159 --> 01:22:57,199
You must want to protect your partner.

949
01:22:57,279 --> 01:23:00,359
This wouldn't have happened
if I hadn't lied to her.

950
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,760
If I'd been unlucky and never woken up,

951
01:23:08,119 --> 01:23:09,840
you'd have taken the fall for her?

952
01:23:10,439 --> 01:23:11,439
Yes, I would have.

953
01:23:14,359 --> 01:23:15,960
It's great that I'm still alive.

954
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,680
I could've missed out
on seeing you beg me like this.

955
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,439
I could do even more than this.

956
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:29,680
I haven't had any food.

957
01:23:31,479 --> 01:23:32,920
Would you really do anything?

958
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:13,600
My leg is numb.

959
01:26:02,359 --> 01:26:04,640
Seeing you love someone this much

960
01:26:06,399 --> 01:26:07,760
is worth waking up for.

961
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:11,800
Some things

962
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,880
aren't this obvious
even when said out loud.

963
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,199
Here's the divorce agreement.

964
01:26:29,479 --> 01:26:30,479
I've signed it.

965
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:32,239
If you agree to sign,

966
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:35,600
I'll submit the paperwork
to the district office now.

967
01:26:40,119 --> 01:26:43,119
When you feel better,
you can sign it there.

968
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:46,720
So that means

969
01:26:48,399 --> 01:26:50,640
this may be
the last time we see each other.

970
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,399
As if we've never been apart before.

971
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,720
Death already parted us once.

972
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,079
What's wrong?

973
01:28:00,319 --> 01:28:01,199
Where does it hurt?

974
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,479
My painkillers must've worn off.

975
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:10,760
It hurts.

976
01:28:21,439 --> 01:28:25,199
What? Miss Khim? What's wrong?

977
01:28:25,279 --> 01:28:26,359
-What is it?
-Khim?

978
01:28:27,239 --> 01:28:28,079
What's wrong?

979
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,039
Rubbing salt in the wound?

980
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,520
Miss Khim, what's wrong?

981
01:28:35,439 --> 01:28:38,439
What did he do to you, my dear Miss Khim?

982
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:41,079
Khim?

983
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:22,960
If you don't beg Khim for forgiveness,
I'll make you end up alone!

984
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:26,720
Why should I apologize to her
when I don't feel guilty?

985
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:30,199
I need an ambulance now!
A bedridden patient's having seizures!

986
01:29:30,279 --> 01:29:31,119
Nate!

987
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,079
He was the one who helped me.

988
01:29:33,159 --> 01:29:34,920
I thought he hated me!

989
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,039
Do you know where Gla is?

990
01:29:37,119 --> 01:29:40,840
If we had a choice, you'd probably choose
not to have me in your life.

991
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:43,239
If we could go back to being strangers,

992
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:44,720
it might be good.

993
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,359
Why was Khim interested in him?

994
01:29:46,439 --> 01:29:49,399
If I said she liked his you-know-what,
could you deal with that?

995
01:29:49,479 --> 01:29:50,920
Get out of Khim's life!

996
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,439
Now I'm gone, try to stay together.

997
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,079
I'm not your excuse anymore.

998
01:29:55,159 --> 01:29:57,119
If she forces herself to stay with you,

999
01:29:57,199 --> 01:29:59,359
it means she still can't move on from me.

1000
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:35,359
