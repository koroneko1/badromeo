00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,400
THIS FICTIONAL SERIES IS INTENDED
FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY

2
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,919
You watch your boyfriend at all hours.
Are you scared he'll get away?

3
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,639
No, I'm scared he'll want
something more casual like you do.

4
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:54,840
Someone else has tried to mess with us.

5
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,199
The housekeeper you hired

6
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,479
is quite something.

7
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,879
Deal with this father and daughter pair.

8
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,599
If you can't handle it,

9
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,120
I'll deal with them myself.

10
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,159
One day,

11
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,479
you'll know the taste
of a lover's betrayal.

12
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,280
Keep this evidence secure.

13
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,199
I'll humiliate him in front of the media

14
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,479
so he won't be able to work in Thailand.

15
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,960
Tell your family that now,

16
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm fighting them kamikaze style.

17
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,319
You think this is enough to defeat me?

18
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,360
I'm just happy to humiliate you
in front of the media.

19
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:28,960
Even if I could create a time machine
and turn back time to meet her,

20
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,599
even if I could erase my mistakes
dozens of times,

21
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,960
it would mean nothing

22
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,560
if we didn't learn to take responsibility

23
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,639
for what we did wrong the first time.

24
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,759
Why did you mess with him?

25
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,080
I just wanted to find out
what he's planning to do to us next.

26
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,560
You couldn't even hurt him,

27
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,240
and he clapped back at you so hard.

28
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,240
Serves you right!

29
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,479
At least I found out

30
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,479
he's going to open
a boutique hotel opposite ours.

31
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,919
He's talking to the property owner.

32
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What are you waiting for?
He'll gain the upper hand, so stop him!

33
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,240
I'm trying, Dad.

34
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,719
I'm trying to make contact
with the hotel owner.

35
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,480
You'll fall for his tricks.
You're never wise to them!

36
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,279
So is our condo project still viable?

37
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,879
Gaogla keeps visiting that house.

38
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,959
The property owner seems to favor him.

39
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,000
But I don't yet know
the details of their negotiations.

40
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,839
Good. If we can't have it, neither can he!

41
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,279
I have a suggestion.

42
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:42,240
Ten years ago, that land was
almost expropriated to build a gallery.

43
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,560
If we restart that project
and expropriate that land,

44
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,959
Gaogla will lose.

45
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,360
That's good.

46
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,319
That's how we'll get back at him.

47
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:01,160
I hope no one lets in
his Trojan horse again.

48
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,759
I'm not easily satisfied.

49
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,680
You know what?

50
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,439
Getting revenge on you alone isn't enough.

51
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,519
What did I do to you?

52
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,839
What made you want revenge on me?

53
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,759
I've also asked myself

54
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,680
what I ever did to your family.

55
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,639
What your family did to me,

56
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,279
I'll do it back to you all.

57
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,079
But it might hurt you worse
if you never learn.

58
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,000
Good job correcting your course
in time the other day.

59
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,319
They wanted to play dirty with me.
I only gave as good as I got.

60
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,800
Their new strategy is probably
to take that old house.

61
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,079
We'll have to close
the boutique hotel deal ASAP.

62
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,879
That place will be our first hotel,

63
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,920
so it'll definitely create buzz.

64
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,399
I want you to see it in person.

65
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,519
I don't think it's suitable for a hotel.

66
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,079
Let me take you there.

67
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,959
I'll show you what I want to do with it.

68
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,079
But if you disagree,

69
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,720
I can change my mind.

70
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,360
You're so confident.

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,319
I would love to know
what you're dreaming of.

72
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,199
If Mr. Seen changes his mind
and builds a gallery instead,

73
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:17,319
Prom's condo project will never go ahead.

74
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:20,240
But Mr. Prom isn't so good
at running such big projects anyway.

75
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,480
I want Prom to get to prove himself.

76
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,399
The gallery project is just politics.

77
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,319
He just wants to defeat Gaogla

78
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:29,319
while we get almost nothing in return.

79
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,560
Let's take back this project

80
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,120
so you can run it,
and you can trainÂ Prom little by little.

81
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,120
If you keep playing his errand boy,

82
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,360
when can we ever stop sneaking around?

83
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,800
Is the award ceremony tonight?

84
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,480
Yeah.

85
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,639
They say this award is cursed.

86
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,439
Whoever wins

87
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,600
either stays single or gets divorced.

88
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,800
Then I can help you break the curse.

89
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,560
If you do win the award,

90
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,279
I'll let you wear the pants
in our relationship.

91
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,040
Don't you think Lita could win?

92
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,480
Our Lita?

93
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:38,279
If she knew she'd have to stay single,
I doubt she'd still want to win.

94
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,600
Congratulations on winning
Woman of the Year.

95
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:50,720
Woman of the Year? Me?

96
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,480
Yes, you.

97
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,840
You're kidding, right?

98
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,799
Hello.

99
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,960
We'd like to record an interview
for tonight's press kit.

100
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,679
We need a minute to prepare.

101
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:09,600
All right.

102
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,200
Hell, that does hurt.

103
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,200
So your dream has come true.

104
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,840
What dream, sir?

105
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:30,879
You'll outdo Saikhim
for the first time in your life.

106
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,759
It'd be even cooler

107
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,559
if you got to be
the director of a new gallery.

108
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,639
What's this?

109
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,120
An application for that job.

110
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:49,960
They'll be recruiting
gallery directors soon.

111
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,159
And your victory today will pave the way

112
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,639
for you to gracefully accept
the position of the new gallery director.

113
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,240
I bought this award to upgrade you
even though it should go to Saikhim.

114
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:07,879
Well?

115
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,440
Am I generous?

116
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,320
Aren't you touched?

117
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,000
You bought the award?

118
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,519
What does this mean?

119
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,440
Gaogla wants to open
a competing hotel opposite mine.

120
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,440
I need you to help me get rid of him

121
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:25,039
by opening this gallery to beat him to it.

122
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,879
You cut him out of Saikhim's life once.

123
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,320
Why don't you do it again

124
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,639
to win this award?

125
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,919
The Stupid Woman of the Year Award.

126
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,840
That's what you think I deserve, right?

127
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,320
If you don't want it, don't accept it.

128
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:41,840
Let Saikhim have it.

129
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,840
How could you do this?

130
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,799
Would you rather let Gaogla expose you

131
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:55,200
for switching the letters
and making them break up?

132
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,519
If you promise me

133
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,879
that you'll keep everything secret

134
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,159
and keep him out of Saikhim's life,

135
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,440
I promise

136
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,679
I'll pay for you
to study in England with her.

137
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,960
The one who'd blackmail me isn't Gaogla.

138
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,279
That would be you!

139
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,480
And I'm not Saikhim.

140
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:22,080
I won't let you control her life
with your dirty tricks!

141
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,480
If you don't seize this chance,

142
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,159
your life will never get better again.

143
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,440
A reward for being a good girl
that Saikhim misses out on when she's bad?

144
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,080
Of course I don't want it.

145
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,240
I don't need to win it.

146
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,159
I don't care.

147
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,279
For the 2021Â Woman of the Year Award,

148
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,480
we selected women
who play important roles inâ¦

149
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:03,639
You're not going in?

150
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:06,879
Are you afraid you'll lose
and be disappointed?

151
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,559
Be more gracious.

152
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,679
Can't you bear it
when someone outdoes you?

153
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,960
And the Woman of the Year Award

154
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,480
for this year goes to

155
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:22,919
Ms. Lita Thongma,
an up-and-coming young designer,

156
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,879
for her globally recognized talent.

157
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,799
Congratulations!

158
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm happy for you.

159
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,840
Where are you going?
Accept your award first.

160
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,600
It should've gone to Khim.

161
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,320
Hey. Accept your award first.

162
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,120
Accept your award first!

163
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,759
Hi, Ms. Lita. Come on.
It's your cue to accept the award now.

164
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,639
Please go ahead.

165
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,480
Ms. Lita is here!
Please welcome her to the stage!

166
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,799
-Congratulations, Ms. Lita.
-This way, please. Go ahead.

167
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,639
Congratulations.

168
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,720
Let's get a photo together.
Another round of applause, please!

169
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,240
That girl has accepted the award.

170
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,039
That wasn't so hard.

171
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,559
Take care of her application.

172
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,039
Yes, sir.

173
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:46,559
Lita! Hey!

174
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,879
What's wrong? What happened?

175
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:55,200
This award is supposed to shame me
for not being good enough.

176
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:56,879
That's nuts.

177
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,639
Who'd think that?

178
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,919
It's not an award, Khim.

179
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,840
It's a punishment for us both.

180
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,879
Punishment for what? We did nothing wrong.

181
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,799
Well, forâ¦

182
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,240
the land on the other side
that you didn't give your dad.

183
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,600
You didn't do it,

184
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,360
so I got screwed.

185
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,399
Lita!

186
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,080
-Lita, take it!
-No! I said I don't want it!

187
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:27,039
-But Mr. Seen said you should!
-I said no!

188
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,279
As for Mr. Songseen,

189
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,039
tell him to go to hell!

190
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,039
Lita, this way, please.

191
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,919
Miss!

192
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,840
Give her this.

193
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,399
That award

194
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,559
should actually go to you.

195
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:58,000
But a sponsor made a big donation
all of a sudden, so the award was stolen.

196
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,200
They even organized the award ceremony
to secure the prize for their nominee.

197
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,679
How do you know?

198
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:07,320
Well, everyone here tonight knows that.

199
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:10,440
What did you do to offend your dad?

200
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:12,600
Now he's not spoiling you like before.

201
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,080
We may be competitors,

202
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:16,919
but you're smart.

203
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,639
I don't mind.

204
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,799
I'd rather work with you.

205
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,039
By the way, have you heard?

206
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,879
I'm about to open a hotel across the road.

207
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:31,240
If you feel uncomfortable staying here,

208
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,480
you can come and work with me.

209
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,840
Don't stay and let men

210
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,679
treat you like their puppet.

211
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,399
Where's Dad?

212
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,200
He's gone out again.

213
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,799
GALLERY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT MODEL

214
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,879
â¦the land on the other side
that you didn't give your dad.

215
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,159
You didn't do it,

216
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,080
so I got screwed.

217
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:40,440
I'm about to open a hotel across the road.

218
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:44,120
If you feel uncomfortable staying here,

219
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
you can come and work with me.

220
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,320
Hey, bro.

221
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,200
That gallery project just got resurrected.

222
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,480
They want to expropriate
that old property.

223
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,639
It can't be a coincidence.

224
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:07,440
It was your father-in-law
who brought this project back.

225
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,039
He must want to mess with us.

226
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:13,039
What will you do?

227
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,000
I'll talk to Gloy first.

228
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,000
Turn your face up.

229
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,000
Gloy?

230
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,640
Where are you now? You're late.

231
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,319
I can't make it now.

232
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,440
Is something wrong?

233
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,480
Look, I'm busy. I'll call you back later.

234
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,960
Khem, what the hell's going on?

235
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:40,079
Why won't Gloy come here?

236
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,240
I'll find out.

237
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,680
Are we done here?

238
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,440
Cut!

239
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,960
-Claire, take a break.
-Sure.

240
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,799
Carl.

241
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,519
My mom's flight is landing tonight.

242
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,599
Why did you invite her here?

243
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,079
I'm introducing you to my family,
so I want us all to be together.

244
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:05,640
I wonder if your mom will like me.

245
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,400
I'm not her favorite.
She's not so protective of me.

246
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,960
So no pressure.

247
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,759
Don't worry.

248
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,200
Whoa, it's so pretty.

249
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,480
How did you find this place?

250
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:23,119
I was staying at the hotel opposite here.

251
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,240
It's nice and cool here.

252
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,960
When this flower is on you,
it looks even prettier.

253
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,720
Claire, this is Asia, my adoptive mom.

254
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,480
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello, darling.

255
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,759
We meet at last.

256
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:40,559
Please come in.

257
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,119
-Hello.
-I want to ask you about that old house.

258
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,960
I've prepared food
just for you, Madame Asia.

259
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,519
Have you had this before?

260
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,680
I haven't, but I'm not very fussy.

261
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:12,920
Just like Carl.

262
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,319
He's not fussy either.

263
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,480
Sometimes he's so laid-back,
he's almost careless.

264
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,640
He always eats rich, bland food.

265
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,920
He can't really be taught
to have better tastes.

266
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,079
Mom.

267
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,079
-There you are.
-Yes.

268
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,480
I'm sorry I'm late.

269
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:50,440
Do you visit your home in Thailand often?

270
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,759
Actually, I never visitÂ at all.

271
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,279
You see,

272
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,920
I have no home here anymore,
so there's no reason to.

273
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,960
But don't you have any relatives
who still live here?

274
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:02,640
No, I don't.

275
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,160
I invited you all here today
because I'd like to start food tours here.

276
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,680
Auntie, since you're a good cook,

277
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,480
I'd like to bring tourists here
to enjoy your cooking

278
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,240
in this friendly atmosphere.

279
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:16,400
Thank you so much.

280
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,680
You should do it.
All your food is tasty and hard to find.

281
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:21,200
Thank you, my dear.

282
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:24,119
This house is beautiful
because it's lively.

283
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,079
I want visitors

284
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,880
to experience this loving atmosphere
that's just like a family visit.

285
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,839
Auntie is compiling
a book of traditional Thai recipes,

286
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,839
so I'd like to ask you
to work on the manuscript.

287
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,119
Of course.

288
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,039
Excuse me. Another guest just arrived.

289
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,039
Another guest?

290
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:48,079
That might be my guest.

291
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,000
I hope you don't mind
that I went ahead and invited someone.

292
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,640
When I heard that this meal was special,

293
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:58,279
I wanted to invite this person.

294
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:01,240
-Please excuse me.
-I'll go and get them.

295
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,759
Miss Khim, please go on in.

296
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:13,599
Everyone is there already.

297
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:19,960
Why are you here?

298
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,079
Your adoptive mom invited me.

299
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:24,960
Don't you have manners?

300
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
The host didn't invite you.
Why did you come?

301
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,519
I told you. Your mom invited me.

302
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,200
I invited her myself.

303
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:37,799
Don't be rude to my guest.

304
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,480
Come on in, darling.

305
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,440
This is Saikhim.
Her family owns the hotel across the road.

306
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:58,599
Well, hello, my dear.

307
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,680
Well, we're neighbors, aren't we?

308
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,400
-Come on in.
-Please sit.

309
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,279
Come on, Miss Khim, let's eat.

310
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:27,880
This is my mom.

311
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,839
Mom, this is Miss Khim, my idol.

312
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,119
Nice to meet you.

313
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,839
This isÂ Rarin.

314
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,559
She flew from America.

315
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,079
She just arrived today.

316
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,400
Rarin?

317
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,240
Come and sit here, Miss Khim.

318
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,720
Would you believe
that I was a picky eater as a kid?

319
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:19,720
Mom had to make me a packed lunch
to take to school every day.

320
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:22,160
And I only ate
Mom's chicken stew all the time.

321
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,400
Can you guess
what was the only Thai food Mom made me?

322
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:30,279
American fried rice.
The American kids had never heard of it.

323
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,720
Right, Mom?

324
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,160
How nice.

325
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:40,880
I don't have a mom.

326
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:44,079
I don't know what a mom's cooking is like.

327
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:46,640
When I get sick,

328
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:49,119
and I think of home-cooked meals,

329
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,680
for me, home-cooked meals,

330
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,400
they'reâ¦

331
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:56,519
they don't exist.

332
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:58,200
I don't know what they are.

333
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,200
What are you doing?

334
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,839
Why did you invite Saikhim tonight?

335
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,640
Are you datingÂ Claire

336
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:39,640
because she and Saikhim share a mom?

337
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,640
You knew,

338
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,480
so you brought them together.

339
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,599
Didn't you do everything
to make today happen?

340
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,279
The day Saikhim finds out her mom left her
to have a new daughter?

341
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,599
Well, here's your chance for revenge.
What are you waiting for?

342
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,400
Even so, you have no right to interfere.

343
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,200
You're saying you're not holding a grudge?
What did you make all these plans for?

344
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:06,720
If you want to be cruel, do it properly.

345
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,960
Go in for the kill.

346
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,880
You're not taking this seriously.

347
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:26,039
Whoa, it looks so difficult.
It's so elaborate.

348
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,079
My dear,

349
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,720
noble ladies in the old days had to know

350
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,799
how to carve fruit,

351
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,279
roll betel leaves,

352
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:38,400
and make traditional dumplings
and crispy pancakes

353
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,759
to call themselves proper noble ladies.

354
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,759
Actually, it's not so hard.
Let me show you.

355
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,279
There.

356
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,759
Put it there for them.

357
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:58,640
-Try it. Please go ahead.
-Try carving the fruit.

358
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,480
Thank you.

359
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,960
-Try it.
-Good.

360
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,559
-How do I start?
-Okay. Look.

361
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,880
-Teach them.
-First, we have to make the base.

362
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,519
Right.

363
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,240
-Can you do it?
-Maybe.

364
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,200
Look.

365
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,640
-See?
-It looks like a flower.

366
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,920
You're so good at this, Mom.

367
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:24,799
It's not so hard. It's finished.

368
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:27,480
-Oh no!
-My dear!

369
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,400
-You're bleeding!
-Careful.

370
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,240
I'm all right.

371
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,240
I'll clean myself up.

372
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,559
My goodness!

373
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,400
I hope it's not a deep cut.

374
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,839
I'm so sorry.

375
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:25,200
Does it hurt, honey?

376
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:30,599
It hurts less than knowing

377
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,279
you're still alive, Mom.

378
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:36,680
But everyone said that my mom died.

379
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,440
So whyâ¦

380
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:45,680
Your dad wouldn't let us see each other.

381
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:48,119
He claimed that I died,

382
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,920
and he made me
walk out of your life that day.

383
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:03,039
Not only are you still alive,

384
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,799
you also have a new daughter.

385
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,839
What am I supposed to think?

386
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,720
Claire isn't my real daughter.

387
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,079
She's my new husband's daughter,
so I had to raise her.

388
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,440
I feel so much better.

389
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:20,119
You didn't just leave your child,

390
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,920
you raised someone else's.

391
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,599
You were so young.

392
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,880
You wouldn't have understood.

393
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,559
So you had to pretend
you didn't know your own daughter?

394
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:36,599
Okay. I get it now.

395
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,839
Ma'am, I can't even call you Mom.

396
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,880
Let's just say

397
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:45,319
that we've never met, okay?

398
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:50,279
As far as you're concerned,
I never existed anyway.

399
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,000
All these ghosts are coming back to life.

400
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:32,160
You all came back to mock me, didn't you?

401
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,200
This is just how your dad makes
people around you disappear.

402
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,400
You can't blame everyone for leaving you.

403
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,680
It's you who disrespects
and kills everyone.

404
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,720
You really want to hurt me?

405
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,279
If you do,

406
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,759
you've succeeded.

407
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,000
I'm in pain.Â Are you happy now?

408
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:51,599
You're in pain

409
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,039
because it hurts to see us
doing better without you.

410
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,319
I'm in pain
because I still remember who you were.

411
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,079
You were someone who never hurt me.

412
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,839
Where are you hiding him?

413
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,720
He's the one I wish I could get back.

414
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:24,079
How much must you hate me
to do this to me?

415
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:36,960
I just want you
to be unable to love again.

416
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:41,039
You selfish people don't deserve love.

417
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,279
Ask yourself this.

418
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:46,599
As a mom, what did you do to your kid?

419
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,720
-What do you mean?
-You can't love anyone but yourself.

420
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,319
So now you have no one left.

421
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,960
Not even your dad.
You think he cares a lot about you.

422
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,640
But he's not honest with you.
He took your mom away from you,

423
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,359
saying only that she wasn't worthy.

424
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,440
I guess you know now

425
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,000
that it's you who isn't worthy of us.

426
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,200
So this is it.

427
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,119
This is the lesson you want me to learn.

428
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,119
Hey! You're going to leave just like that?

429
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,880
Where's Miss Khim?

430
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,440
Well,

431
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:37,599
she left.

432
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,200
Right. So did Carl go to see her off?

433
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:42,160
No, he's on the phone.

434
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,079
Right. No wonder he disappeared.

435
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,000
-Yeah.
-Wait inside with us, ma'am.

436
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:47,480
Sure, darling.

437
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,119
Khim!

438
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,839
Khim!

439
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,839
Khim!

440
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,279
Khim!

441
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:47,799
Khim!

442
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,359
Khim!

443
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:31,960
Miss Khim!

444
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:34,840
What happened to you?
What have you been doing?

445
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,880
Miss Khim! What's wrong?

446
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,679
You must care a lot about her
if you ran out after her.

447
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,360
Are you happy now?

448
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,119
Don't give me attitude.

449
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,840
You did everything to get here today.

450
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,440
She's probably shouting at her dad now.

451
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:01,519
Everything is going as you planned.

452
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,360
Did you come to threaten me?

453
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,159
You're too softhearted.

454
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:09,440
That's why your life can't get any better.

455
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:16,079
You should be fighting with them, not me.

456
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:20,199
Don't try to pick a fight with me.

457
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,960
Do you need to get something in here?

458
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:56,199
Dad, guess who I just saw.

459
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:58,840
I just saw Mom.

460
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
I've seen everyone who died and came back.

461
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:05,159
The truth is

462
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,159
they're still alive, aren't they?

463
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,719
Dad, explain to me
what the hell is going on!

464
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:35,199
I did something
that Saikhim's dad couldn't live with.

465
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,840
He said that I don't deserve
to be someone's mother.

466
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,199
So he pressured me

467
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,280
to stay away from Saikhim.

468
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:05,760
Look at these photos.

469
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,639
Look!

470
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,320
Do women who are willing
to pose for such lewd photos

471
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,559
deserve to continue being mothers?

472
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,360
She fell for the photographer.
He tricked her into posing for this smut,

473
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,239
and the photos were leaked.

474
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,559
I couldn't bear the shame!

475
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,360
How was my daughter supposed to live?

476
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:38,000
She couldn't face people's judgment,

477
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:39,840
so she attempted suicide.

478
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:44,840
She was the one who left me and you first!

479
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,360
I was so youngâ¦

480
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,760
so I did something stupid
to solve the problem.

481
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,880
I took pills to kill myself

482
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,719
and to get back atÂ Seen
for not forgiving me.

483
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,760
I kept blaming myself

484
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,840
and forgot to think of Khim.

485
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,599
I wanted to run away from my problems.

486
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,719
He made me feel like I was disgusting.

487
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:27,920
Too disgusting to be a mother.

488
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,719
Then I found out

489
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,679
that while he thought I was wicked,

490
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,519
he was already looking for
a new mom for Saikhim.

491
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:39,679
He let someone replace me.

492
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,280
Later, I realized

493
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,679
that maybe my story became a scandal
because someone leaked it on purpose

494
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,440
so that they could break up our family.

495
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:54,400
When I suggested that she die
and disappear from your life,

496
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,199
she agreed to do it

497
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,079
though you were so young.

498
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,639
She didn't care about you at all.

499
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:05,519
She was so unfaithful.
Why should I have held onto her?

500
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,360
If you decide to leave,

501
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,119
don't let her see your face again.

502
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:12,960
She wanted to be with someone else.
She chose to have a new life.

503
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,400
I warned her in the strongest terms
that she'd never see you again.

504
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,320
She left anyway.

505
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,199
It's unbelievable

506
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:22,960
how selfish she was.

507
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:27,880
I agreed to walk away

508
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,559
to let Saikhim think
that her mom died back thenâ¦

509
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:37,280
and to allow Seen
to hold his head up high in public.

510
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,119
That's why I couldn't see Khim again.
And she was so young.

511
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:46,440
She didn't even understand sadness.

512
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:56,239
Because this whole time,
she's only known one side of the story,

513
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:58,480
I don't know

514
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,119
why I should destroy this girl's life now.

515
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:05,960
After all, we've managed
to get on with our lives all this time.

516
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,239
Why did you keep me in the dark
this whole time, Dad?

517
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:25,039
You lied to me
about something so important.

518
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,360
Is there anything left in this life
I can trust you on?

519
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,800
What did Rarin say to you?

520
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,119
Why is she back?

521
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,440
Mom has a new daughter now.

522
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,760
And that daughter is
Gaogla's new girlfriend.

523
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,239
Gaogla again?

524
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,760
He never gives us a moment's peace.

525
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,639
-Why don't you criticize him too?
-He only showed me the truth to hurt me.

526
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,480
Even if it hurts, at least it's the truth!

527
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,400
I'm wondering if his death and mom's

528
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,199
were just your excuses.

529
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:04,719
You use me as an excuse
to get rid of everyone you don't like!

530
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,119
What are you talking about?

531
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:10,280
Gaogla said that we are
the ones who killed him.

532
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,880
Why did Gla go to jail?

533
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,320
Can you explain that to me?

534
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,079
You let him manipulate you again?

535
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,119
Well,

536
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:23,920
when someone is unworthy,
you don't keep them around anymore!

537
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,320
And now I'm unworthy
of being your daughter,

538
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,159
so you bought that award for Lita
just to use her to grind me down, right?

539
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:36,880
Lita sees you as a competitor.
She's never even seen you as a friend!

540
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,400
She's done everything to outdo you!

541
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,360
You know what?
She'd steal your boyfriend if she could!

542
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,280
So what?

543
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,320
If I'm not as good as Lita, willâ¦

544
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:49,599
will that embarrass you?

545
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:52,480
Will you kill me like this too?

546
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:18,400
Maybe Mr. Seen lied

547
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,079
because he didn't want you
to hate your own mom.

548
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,960
Lies

549
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:25,199
are sometimes told out of kindness, honey.

550
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:29,519
Just like how you're consoling me

551
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,159
but you're actually laughing at me?

552
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,079
Miss Khim?

553
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:38,519
Your dad really wanted the best for you.

554
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:39,639
Believe me.

555
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,960
But Auntie Oon,
you don't tell me the truth either.

556
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,239
How sad for poorÂ Saikhim.

557
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,119
Everyone around her

558
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:55,320
is so insincere.

559
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:26,159
Khim! What have you been doing?

560
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:33,320
What happened, Khim?

561
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,639
Can Iâ¦ stay the night here?

562
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,559
What's wrong, Khim?

563
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:42,800
I called, but you didn't answer.

564
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:20,199
I just want you
to be unable to love again.

565
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,639
You selfish people don't deserve love.

566
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,440
Ask yourself this.

567
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,159
As a mom, what did you do to your kid?

568
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,840
Do women who are willing
to pose for such lewd photos

569
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,159
deserve to continue being mothers?

570
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,239
She fell for the photographer.
He tricked her into posing for this smut.

571
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,360
She was the one who left me and you first!

572
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,199
Shall we go and see your mom?

573
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:18,960
Let's hear her side of the story.

574
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,000
Don't make any rash decisions now.

575
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:29,880
People have good sides and bad ones.

576
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,000
But it doesn't mean

577
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,039
they can't be parents.

578
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:38,800
Your dad wouldn't let us see each other.

579
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,199
He claimed that I died,

580
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,360
and he made me
walk out of your life that day.

581
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,119
You didn't just leave your child,

582
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,800
you raised someone else's.

583
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,320
You were so young.

584
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,760
You wouldn't have understood.

585
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:40,360
You can't love anyone but yourself.

586
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,199
So now you have no one left.

587
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,679
You really want to hurt me?

588
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,239
If you do,

589
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:49,679
you've succeeded.

590
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,960
I'm in pain.Â Are you happy now?

591
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,800
You're in pain

592
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,360
because it hurts to see us
doing better without you.

593
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,480
I'm in pain
because I still remember who you were.

594
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,039
You were someone who never hurt me.

595
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,480
Where are you hiding him?

596
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:14,360
He's the one I wish I could get back.

597
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,599
THE WELL-BEING SCHOOL

598
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,239
Is he sleeping, or rehearsing for death?

599
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:56,960
I think he's tired.

600
00:47:57,559 --> 00:47:58,440
He drove very far.

601
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,639
As for you,

602
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:03,559
give him a chance now.

603
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:05,559
But Dad!

604
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,440
Do you see that?

605
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,920
Do you think I'm a beggar
who can't be a chooser?

606
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:20,800
If you don't like him,
don't keep him to yourself.

607
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,280
When have I ever done that?

608
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,039
Well, you ground down his confidence
by saying that he's filthy

609
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,239
to stop him flirting with other women.

610
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,000
You're mean.

611
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,079
I feel sorry forÂ Khem.

612
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:37,840
He's so innocent.

613
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,280
Gloy, stop, please.

614
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,880
Sorry I didn't look after you.

615
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:54,840
Be careful. Watch your step.

616
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,280
By the way, Gloy,

617
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,679
Gla said you were driving
back to your dad's place.

618
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,840
Wait. You're pampering me.
Did you do something bad?

619
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,639
What? I'm just being kind.

620
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:12,199
If you appreciate it, thank me.

621
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,440
Don't insult me.

622
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:15,800
Come on.

623
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,280
You're making amends.

624
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,800
-You'd better keep it up.
-All right.

625
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,480
This way, please.

626
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:26,920
Other than guilt,
do you feel anything else?

627
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,519
Maybe she doesn't just want your pity.

628
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,000
This life we're given,

629
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,199
I've lived half of it and got nowhere.

630
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:42,000
The rest of it

631
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,480
I'll give to you if you want.

632
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,800
It might be good for me
to live for someone else.

633
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:51,519
This is unbearable enough.

634
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:54,320
I can't bear the rest of your life!

635
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,239
Ew.

636
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:00,519
It's his fault he's a dummy.
I can't help that.

637
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,559
Where are the land transfer documents?

638
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:08,280
Right. I forgot. I'll go get them for you.

639
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,800
I prepared them already.

640
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,880
Here. This concerns the land.

641
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:26,800
And I found this.
It's been seven or eight years.

642
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,360
I don't know if it's still valid.

643
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,039
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

644
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:35,360
Dad.

645
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:37,800
What is this?

646
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,079
What? It's from back then. Remember?

647
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:42,000
People think Gla died.

648
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:46,079
And he changed his whole name.
I didn't think this was still a problem.

649
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,960
Would this be a big deal?

650
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,400
Well, hurry up and call the lawyer, then.

651
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,800
-Hurry.
-Okay.

652
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:08,480
Yes? Mr. Carl asked me
to deal with the expropriation.

653
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,119
Okay, could you please check the document
that I just sent to your phone?

654
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:14,000
Is it still legally valid?

655
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,480
This is very important.
I need you to check it now, please!

656
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:21,079
All right.

657
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:23,559
Hey, Khem!

658
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,559
Khem, wake up!

659
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:28,199
Get your stuff and come down now!

660
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,559
What? Okay.

661
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:32,639
You're leaving now?

662
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:34,760
-Yeah.
-What did the lawyer say?

663
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,880
I have to go to Bangkok to follow up now.

664
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,119
This is deadly serious.
I have to fix it for Gla now.

665
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:42,760
As for your land transfer,

666
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,159
I'll handle it later.

667
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:46,039
Okay. All right, honey.

668
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:47,440
What's happening?

669
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:50,360
Come on! Don't waste time.

670
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,840
Where are we going? Bye, sir.

671
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,400
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye, sir.

672
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,320
-Come on!
-Khem! Look after my kids.

673
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,360
Yes, sir. Where to?

674
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,079
Listen. Let me tell you something.

675
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:07,360
I am wondering
if they'll transfer some land around here

676
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,920
to build a gallery on.

677
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:11,679
You never know.

678
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,840
Maybe I won't get to die here.

679
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,760
I might even have to move
to a retirement home.

680
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,760
They're empty threats.

681
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:24,920
This project was already canceled once.
I'm looking for ways to threaten them too.

682
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,400
Don't give up yet, Auntie.

683
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,880
Maybe they'll self-destruct.

684
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:40,000
Someone wants to investigate our gallery
for promoting our hotel's interests.

685
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:41,000
What?

686
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:43,800
And they know
we're appointing our own gallery director.

687
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:49,920
How is this possible?
We haven't announced the vacancy yet.

688
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,280
How do they know?

689
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,920
What if Lita betrayed us?

690
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,960
PROTESTERS DEMAND GRAFT PROBE

691
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,440
I bet Gaogla did this.

692
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,320
He's accusing you of corruption.

693
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:07,920
Such stupid advisers

694
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,559
could land you in jail, Uncle.

695
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:21,679
It's you and Khim's marriage certificate.
The lawyer says it's still legally valid.

696
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,360
Gla, you have to divorce her now,
or this could hurt our business.

697
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:38,639
If you don't divorce her,
she can't marry her partner.

698
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:40,880
That's good.

699
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,119
We have the upper hand.

700
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:46,719
Hey, why don't you look bothered?

701
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,159
Are you saying

702
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:50,159
you already thought of the certificate?

703
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:53,440
I'm waiting to see
when Saikhim will figure it out.

704
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,960
Gla!

705
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:01,239
Don't you worry about what would happen
if your girlfriend found out about this?

706
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:07,400
Khim? Are you feeling better?

707
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,320
Yes, a little.

708
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,840
Aren't you busy?

709
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:21,119
I think I'll resign from the bank.
I just spoke to someone about a new job.

710
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,599
It's your family's bank.

711
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,800
Would your dad let you resign?

712
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,719
If I want to grow up,
I have to get out of there,

713
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,159
or Dad will keep dominating me.

714
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,679
LAND EXPROPRIATION GRAFT PROBE

715
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,840
That story's about Dad!

716
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:52,760
LAND EXPROPRIATION GRAFT PROBE

717
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,239
It's about your hotel too.

718
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:01,800
He's coming after my dad.

719
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,119
Who is?

720
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,079
Picking up an item?

721
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:16,719
Yes, I am.

722
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,239
Was it you who had someone
request a graft probe on my dad?

723
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,480
Your dad wanted
to expropriate this land for himself.

724
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,599
He's abusing his power
so he deserves to be investigated.

725
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:46,880
What if we gave you this house?
Would you forget your grudge against me?

726
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,679
I don't want to hold this grudge.

727
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,280
So withdraw the request.

728
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,760
If you want to get revenge on me,
leave other people out of it.

729
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:59,280
You want this house? Take it.
But leave us alone for good.

730
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,760
If only it were that simple.

731
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:05,039
Even if I got this land,
we might still be co-owners.

732
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,400
We never got divorced.
Legally, we're the same person.

733
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,480
That's impossible.

734
00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:24,599
Sometimes retribution comes
in the form of marriage.

735
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,840
So let's get divorced.

736
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:27,800
I'd love to.

737
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,960
But I need to make sure
you won't take my money.

738
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:33,280
Who wants your money?

739
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,159
This land isn't even mine,
and you want it anyway.

740
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:38,079
Can I trust litigious people like you?

741
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,679
So what do you want?

742
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:41,800
Give me your hotel shares

743
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,639
if you want to remarry.

744
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:46,599
If you've a better offer,
I'll consent to the divorce.

745
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,639
Dream on.

746
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,199
So let your husband-to-be wait forever.
You won't marry him in this life.

747
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:56,239
Maybe you will in the next.

748
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,719
How long have you been here?

749
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,039
Let's talk.

750
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:19,000
What were you and Saikhim talking about?
Do you know each other from somewhere?

751
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,519
We do.

752
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:24,000
What marriage were you talking about?

753
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,719
We dated for a little while.

754
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,239
Just dating? Or were you married?

755
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:32,280
And does Claire know about this?

756
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,320
It was a long time ago.
I haven't told Claire.

757
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,400
I've been with Claire
longer than I was with her.

758
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,519
I'm not interested in her anymore.

759
00:57:40,599 --> 00:57:42,159
Let me tell you something.

760
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,800
Nature lets time slowly destroy love,

761
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,920
anger, vengeance, infatuation,

762
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:49,840
and sadness,

763
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:52,400
leaving only memories.

764
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,760
It's like

765
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,320
how I've forgotten the disappointment
I had with Saikhim's dad.

766
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,920
From what I've seen,

767
00:58:01,239 --> 00:58:03,559
it's like you're trying to defy nature.

768
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,840
You're afraid of forgetting something.

769
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:11,800
Can you honestly say
that Saikhim means nothing to you?

770
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,360
If circumstances didn't bring us all
here together like this,

771
00:58:19,239 --> 00:58:23,840
I'd never let my daughter get stuck
in such a complicated relationship.

772
00:58:25,159 --> 00:58:26,320
No matter which daughter.

773
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:38,760
Legally,

774
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:42,840
if we can prove that a married couple
has not cohabited for over three years,

775
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:46,320
that marriage has ended,

776
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,679
and they can file for divorce.

777
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:54,239
If they don't file for divorce,
are there easier ways to end this?

778
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:58,039
They can both sign a divorce agreement,
but both parties must give consent.

779
00:58:58,119 --> 00:58:59,920
What about their assets?

780
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,400
That will be a problem.

781
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,159
They have to find solutions together.

782
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,400
This divorce agreement includes
the following conditions.

783
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,599
You won't demand marital property.

784
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,519
The assets acquired during the marriage

785
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,920
will be considered
each party's personal property.

786
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,639
You can try making this offer to him.

787
00:59:21,719 --> 00:59:26,760
If he has no objections to the terms,
you may not need to file for divorce.

788
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,400
I heard you've consulted a lawyer.

789
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,880
So that means you and Saikhim signed
a marriage certificate, right?

790
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,960
This woman could bankrupt you.

791
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:26,760
Our business

792
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,039
is Nate's too.

793
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:33,599
I won't let anyone else
try to steal my son's inheritance.

794
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,760
Before you enter the stock market,
deal with this mess once and for all.

795
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,679
Yes, ma'am.

796
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,679
I'll never put the company at risk.

797
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,440
When your father snuck around
with your mother,

798
01:00:54,519 --> 01:00:55,920
he said the same thing.

799
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:59,199
Men don't do things definitively.

800
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,960
That's why this mess has escalated now.

801
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:04,840
You're lucky you didn't have kids,
or they'd come begging!

802
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:05,800
Yes, know!

803
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,360
I'm already freeloading.

804
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,760
You can barely deal with me.

805
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:26,719
The designer sent this
decorating plan for the boutique hotel.

806
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,760
If you don't finalize this divorce,

807
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,559
I'll take this project back.

808
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:33,880
Don't let your ex-wife

809
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,440
steal this opportunity.

810
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,639
I guarantee that I'll deal with it.

811
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:45,840
If you can be tied down
by a piece of paper,

812
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,559
you must be really weak.

813
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,199
BOUTIQUE HOTEL DESIGN

814
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:39,159
Hey, bro, what did she do to you?

815
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,360
Nothing yet.

816
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,880
But she might try to take everything back.
We're playing into her hands.

817
01:02:47,719 --> 01:02:48,559
Wait.

818
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:50,559
You have to get divorced now.

819
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:52,519
She'll have no excuse to take your firm.

820
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:57,880
If I have to obey her every command,
I'll only be a mindless body like him.

821
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,920
I wasn't born to be anyone's errand boy.

822
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,360
I won't let anyone replace youâ¦

823
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:29,719
because we shouldn't covet
someone else's destiny.

824
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,639
So that means you can't marry Tan yet?

825
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,559
Not only can't I marry him,
I also can't let him know about this.

826
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:19,800
I gotta get divorced
before Tan suspects something.

827
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,719
And does your dad know about this?

828
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:24,880
He can't know either.

829
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:28,960
Right now, other than us,
the only person who knows is Auntie Oon.

830
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,760
But I guess she doesn't suspect what I do.

831
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:36,320
There's no reason he won't get divorced.
He has to protect his interests too.

832
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:42,159
But I have to placate him
with the divorce papers

833
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:44,440
before he uses my past to blackmail me.

834
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,519
Honestly, I'm so afraid
of what he might do.

835
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,920
If he could kill me
so he could be single again,

836
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,280
I think he would.

837
01:04:54,039 --> 01:04:55,800
He wouldn't go that far, right?

838
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,519
He hates me so much, he could do anything.

839
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:03,719
You used to love each other so much.
How could he hate you this much?

840
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,280
Hey!

841
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:17,480
Soâ¦ did Dad get you involved
in this gallery too?

842
01:05:22,199 --> 01:05:23,480
I dodged that bullet.

843
01:05:23,559 --> 01:05:25,199
Otherwise, I'd be screwed.

844
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,320
They'd say I was your dad's plant.

845
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:34,000
Lita, I'm sorry
that Dad brought you into this mess.

846
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:36,360
He's paying for it now.

847
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:38,840
Not only can't he steal that land,

848
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:43,199
he's getting interrogated so much,
he may lose his job as a minister.

849
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:57,199
Did you tell anyone

850
01:05:57,719 --> 01:05:59,960
that I nominated you
as the gallery director?

851
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,519
Here's the evidence.

852
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:04,079
Take it if you're so scared.

853
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,719
Who leaked this story?

854
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:08,159
Now Gaogla has reported me.

855
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:11,639
If you're worried I'm a double agent,
you should never have involved me.

856
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:13,840
Forget all this.

857
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:16,000
If anyone asks,

858
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,360
you must say that you know nothing!

859
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:25,400
Of course.

860
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,360
Abuse of power

861
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:29,440
has never been my thing.

862
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,400
Good.

863
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,480
Just don't turn on me later.

864
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:36,360
And you shouldn't use Saikhim's letter
to threaten me again!

865
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,079
If you do,

866
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,320
I might change my mind,

867
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,400
switch sides, and tell Gaogla
that you wrote that fake letter

868
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,119
and used me

869
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:47,920
to break up their relationship.

870
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,440
If he finds out,

871
01:06:52,519 --> 01:06:55,360
he might make you
pay for what you did plus interest

872
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,199
even worse than what's going on now.

873
01:07:02,679 --> 01:07:05,880
Good manners really can't be taught.

874
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:11,280
You paid for my education,
not an attitude adjustment.

875
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,119
Our bad habits

876
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:14,440
die hard, don't they?

877
01:07:26,599 --> 01:07:28,079
Watch Lita closely.

878
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:30,360
-See if she contacts Gaogla.
-Yes, sir.

879
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,599
We're requesting a graft probe
into the gallery,

880
01:07:32,679 --> 01:07:34,599
so we need to know if you're in on it,

881
01:07:34,679 --> 01:07:36,119
or if you just got used.

882
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,199
He can't even protect himself.

883
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,079
Do you think he can protect you?

884
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,320
I think

885
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,840
she bites the hand that feeds.

886
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,800
I usually train here,
but I haven't had much time lately.

887
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:08,440
I know you're having a tough time
with work and your family,

888
01:08:08,519 --> 01:08:11,239
so I thought I'd bring you here
to blow off some steam.

889
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:15,320
If you want to vent for any reason,
give me all you've got.

890
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,319
I'll be your emotional punching bag.

891
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:20,079
Too tight?

892
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:21,000
-It's fine.
-Good.

893
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:22,800
-Coach?
-Yes?

894
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,920
-Please look after this student.
-Of course.

895
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:29,319
Should we warm up?

896
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:34,920
Wait. Miss Khim!

897
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:36,520
Hey, it's Miss Khim.

898
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:37,920
That's my mom.

899
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,880
What a coincidence.
You're boxing here too?

900
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,439
I brought her.

901
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,680
Carl needs volunteers
to teach foreignersÂ Muay Thai

902
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,920
in exchange for foreign language classes,

903
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,720
so I wanted to give it a try.

904
01:08:54,039 --> 01:08:54,880
Hello, ma'am.

905
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,359
I'm Tanthai, Khim's partner.

906
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:02,560
This is great.

907
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,439
I'll have a study buddy.

908
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,399
Looks like she doesn't want one.

909
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:11,199
She looks more like she wants an opponent.

910
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:12,960
Her hands are itching for a fight.

911
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,960
Khim told me all about you, ma'am.

912
01:09:23,119 --> 01:09:26,319
You see, we're getting married
in five or six months.

913
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:29,640
If you don't mind,

914
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:33,239
I'd like to invite you to honor us
with your presence at our wedding.

915
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,560
But

916
01:09:39,159 --> 01:09:41,680
Khim's father might not want me there.

917
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:45,359
But I'm happy for you.

918
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:49,680
I guess Khim wants
to build a perfect family.

919
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:51,880
One that she's never had.

920
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,920
I guess Khim is still in shock.

921
01:09:55,239 --> 01:09:56,279
But deep down,

922
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:59,760
I think she's happy
to know that you're still around.

923
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,920
I think we should make the best
of our time together today.

924
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,680
-Right block.
-Left hook.

925
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,039
Great job, Claire.

926
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:21,640
Very good.

927
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:27,079
-Enough.
-I'm taking a break.

928
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:33,199
When she comes at you, defend yourself.

929
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:35,720
Don't be scared.
If she fights hard, you fight hard.

930
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:41,520
Let's have a duel.

931
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:15,359
-Khim!
-Carl!

932
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:16,560
-Enough!
-Are you okay?

933
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,600
You're weak.

934
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:21,560
-Hey, Carl!
-What the hell?

935
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:23,520
You really want a fight?

936
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:26,840
Hey!

937
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:38,199
Khim!

938
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:40,399
Do you know what you did?

939
01:11:43,239 --> 01:11:44,720
You're a sore loser.

940
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:49,800
Khim.

941
01:11:50,479 --> 01:11:51,319
Let's go.

942
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:52,680
Take a break.

943
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:53,880
Come on.

944
01:11:55,239 --> 01:11:56,079
Let's go.

945
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:04,520
Khim, how could you hit him
when his guard was down?

946
01:12:05,439 --> 01:12:07,960
He had his girlfriend attack me first!

947
01:12:08,039 --> 01:12:09,000
Didn't you see?

948
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:10,560
Okay, Khim.

949
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,479
I think you should take a break,

950
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,439
or you'll get angrier during training.

951
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:15,359
Come on.

952
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,039
Jeez, Tan.

953
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:19,760
I'm not scared of weaklings like him!

954
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:21,680
All talk, no walk.

955
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,880
Khim, do you realize

956
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,720
that every time you see him,
you lose your temper?

957
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,239
Well, didn't you see him, Tan?

958
01:12:29,319 --> 01:12:30,239
-Heâ¦
-Khim!

959
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:32,600
You have to compartmentalize.

960
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:36,680
Okay, if you want to blow off steam,

961
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,079
I think you'd better take it out
on that sandbag.

962
01:12:39,159 --> 01:12:40,000
Come with me.

963
01:12:41,319 --> 01:12:42,159
Come on.

964
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,159
Right. Yes. Sure thing.

965
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:52,560
Right. I've found it.

966
01:12:55,239 --> 01:12:56,079
That's right.

967
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:58,479
That's correct.

968
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,079
Hold on one second.

969
01:13:03,239 --> 01:13:05,720
Why don't you have him
read these important documents?

970
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,840
Don't flatter yourself.
There are more important things than you.

971
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:12,960
Have him read them
so we can schedule the divorce.

972
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:15,560
Make him read them.

973
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,359
BOUTIQUE HOTEL DESIGN

974
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:19,000
I want his answer today!

975
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:31,079
-Bro.
-Again.

976
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,079
I sent the lawyer the proof.

977
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:34,319
He should also be charged

978
01:13:34,399 --> 01:13:36,680
with unlawfully appointing
a gallery director.

979
01:13:37,399 --> 01:13:39,319
We'll knock him out this time.`

980
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:41,479
I've better news too.

981
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,680
The divorce agreement your wife drew up.

982
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:49,319
Check it out.

983
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:54,279
It says she won't demand` any assets.

984
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:01,680
Kick! Great!

985
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,279
Good! Great!

986
01:14:13,079 --> 01:14:14,439
Great!

987
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,800
You don't want any money from the divorce?

988
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:21,960
Your whole family is the same.

989
01:14:22,039 --> 01:14:23,479
You play dirty then play nice.

990
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:26,159
I'm fair.

991
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:27,800
I don't want anything.

992
01:14:29,239 --> 01:14:30,680
Just sign the papers.

993
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:32,399
I'm almost touched.

994
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,119
If you hadn't ambushed me earlier,
I could've signed them by now.

995
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:44,520
You wanna make me angry?

996
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:46,319
You get angry like your dad.

997
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,760
Would you dare do this
in front of other men?

998
01:14:50,359 --> 01:14:51,640
Just tell me what you want.

999
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:58,199
The farm isn't far from here.

1000
01:14:58,279 --> 01:15:02,039
If those two don't want to go,
I can take you there on the way back.

1001
01:15:05,119 --> 01:15:06,159
Khim.

1002
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:07,960
I invited her to the coconut farm too.

1003
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:14,279
Maybe she'd rather be
with her family, Tan.

1004
01:15:17,439 --> 01:15:18,760
I want to be with you, Khim.

1005
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:21,479
Let me come with you.

1006
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:54,119
Show-off.

1007
01:16:01,399 --> 01:16:02,239
Be careful!

1008
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,640
Okay.

1009
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:08,399
Tan!

1010
01:16:10,359 --> 01:16:12,680
Wait there. I'll come and get you.

1011
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:24,000
To trust me with your life,
we must trust each other.

1012
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:25,239
Then we'll both survive.

1013
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:26,600
Watch out!

1014
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:50,279
Hey.

1015
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:56,279
I want you to get to know your mom.

1016
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,600
The chance for you to spend time with her

1017
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,199
doesn't come around often.

1018
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:06,600
Maybe she feels uncomfortable.

1019
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:08,479
She doesn't want her child to know.

1020
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,279
But I want her to know

1021
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:20,119
I'm ready to look after you in her place.

1022
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:22,239
Then she'll feel assured

1023
01:17:22,319 --> 01:17:24,000
because you trust me with your life.

1024
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:27,079
She doesn't care about me that much, Tan.

1025
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:28,640
Khim.

1026
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:29,600
Pick that up.

1027
01:17:30,199 --> 01:17:32,760
You're the one who's too mean
to care about her.

1028
01:17:34,279 --> 01:17:35,199
That's not true.

1029
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:36,800
Don't make that face.

1030
01:17:37,479 --> 01:17:38,319
Come here.

1031
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,840
Come here. Smile. Go on.

1032
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,199
Aw.

1033
01:17:44,079 --> 01:17:45,359
They're so sweet.

1034
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:46,279
There you go.

1035
01:17:46,359 --> 01:17:47,239
Tan.

1036
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:49,640
Such show-offs.

1037
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:51,880
Pardon?

1038
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:55,600
I said it's too sunny.
It's getting too hot.

1039
01:17:57,479 --> 01:17:58,399
Come here.

1040
01:17:58,479 --> 01:17:59,960
Hold on, okay?

1041
01:18:00,039 --> 01:18:01,119
Let's spoil my mom.

1042
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:02,439
-Okay?
-That hurts.

1043
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,399
Does it hurt? Take this.

1044
01:18:20,439 --> 01:18:21,439
Coconut water.

1045
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,560
-Thank you.
-Sure.

1046
01:18:27,319 --> 01:18:29,439
Can I ask
what Mr. Tan loves about Miss Khim?

1047
01:18:34,279 --> 01:18:36,399
Don't be nosy. They're embarrassed.

1048
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,159
Have you heard the saying,

1049
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:42,520
"True love is
falling for one person every time"?

1050
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,319
That's how I feel about Khim.

1051
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,000
That's very sweet.

1052
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:03,479
See how she finishes her drink
but keeps trying to drink more?

1053
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:05,800
The first time I saw that, I thought,

1054
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,600
"She doesn't care how she looks."

1055
01:19:08,359 --> 01:19:09,640
She looked so natural.

1056
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,119
Every time I think of that,

1057
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:12,680
it makes me smile.

1058
01:19:18,199 --> 01:19:22,960
Disney princesses would never dare
to drink so greedily in front of men.

1059
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:25,560
Don't do that again anywhere.Â It's rude.

1060
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,319
I think you feel the same way, Mr. Carl.

1061
01:19:36,359 --> 01:19:39,000
No, I don't feel that way.
I don't like greedy women.

1062
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,520
Well, I wasn't talking about that.

1063
01:19:42,039 --> 01:19:44,279
-I meant--
-I don't know. I have a short memory.

1064
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:00,359
Hey!

1065
01:20:02,119 --> 01:20:03,479
Where are you throwing them?

1066
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,199
Khim.

1067
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:11,800
I know that you already have everything.

1068
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:17,039
But if anything bothers you,
and you can't talk about it with anyone,

1069
01:20:17,119 --> 01:20:18,960
I want you to think of me.

1070
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,760
Although I'm not
the most important person in your life,

1071
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:29,439
I'm ready to listen to all your problems,
no matter how serious they are.

1072
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,479
I'm ready to help you.

1073
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:42,039
Don't let your dad numb your feelings.

1074
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:47,399
Men who have been disappointed
will not ask for anyone's love.

1075
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:50,359
But they will hurt others

1076
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,399
to protect themselves
from more disappointments.

1077
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:56,520
Men like that

1078
01:20:57,119 --> 01:20:59,760
pressure us to feel guilty
about everything

1079
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:03,199
until we feel we're not good enough.

1080
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:20,000
I don't know what happened
between you and him.

1081
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:27,079
But I think it's for the best
that you're trying to stay away from him.

1082
01:21:30,199 --> 01:21:33,079
You know about us, ma'am?

1083
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,680
Carlâ¦ is a lot like your father.

1084
01:21:38,359 --> 01:21:41,800
I can tell he's hard to live with.
He doesn't say what he means.

1085
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:44,399
He wasn't like this before.

1086
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:47,039
Seen wasn't like this before either.

1087
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:49,960
It was my fault.

1088
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,439
Boys, you must be so tired.

1089
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,720
Take a shower, and then we'll eat.

1090
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:57,720
Yes, sir.

1091
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:10,600
Khim, I'm sorry

1092
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:14,520
if I make you feel bad about your dad.

1093
01:22:15,159 --> 01:22:17,520
Maybe the reason he's like this is

1094
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:19,520
I disappointed him.

1095
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:53,479
Tan? I've brought you a change of clothes.

1096
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:01,159
Where should I leave them for you?

1097
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:09,800
You!

1098
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:11,880
Let go! Are you nuts?

1099
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:16,039
You wanted to flirt with your man?

1100
01:23:16,119 --> 01:23:17,079
Sorry.

1101
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:18,079
I'm the wrong one.

1102
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,359
What are you doing? Hey!

1103
01:23:22,359 --> 01:23:23,399
Don't! No!

1104
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:30,279
Now we're even.
That's for what you did this morning.

1105
01:23:33,399 --> 01:23:34,680
Hey! Wait.

1106
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:39,439
You're too violent.

1107
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:42,319
I'm all beaten-up.

1108
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:45,159
You see this?

1109
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:00,000
That scar, it'sâ¦

1110
01:24:00,079 --> 01:24:01,079
All your fault.

1111
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:03,399
Of course it is.

1112
01:24:04,359 --> 01:24:05,479
What do you mean?

1113
01:24:16,279 --> 01:24:17,119
Excuse me.

1114
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:19,680
Is Mr. Carl in there?

1115
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:33,159
Please feel free toÂ shower in there.
Andâ¦ I'll just shower out here.

1116
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,640
There's no such thing as a secret.

1117
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:45,439
It's okay if everyone knows.

1118
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:47,640
What did you say?

1119
01:24:48,359 --> 01:24:49,199
Hey!

1120
01:24:57,079 --> 01:24:58,000
The bathroom's free.

1121
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,159
Feel free to use it.

1122
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,520
But watch out for creepy-crawlies.

1123
01:25:18,359 --> 01:25:19,199
Hey, Khim.

1124
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:21,960
Why are you all wet?

1125
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:31,760
I got so hot
that I just showered like this.

1126
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,319
Why didn't you get changed?

1127
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:43,600
Do you still have an outfit I can borrow?

1128
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:44,920
Let's find one.

1129
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,039
-All right.
-Come on.

1130
01:26:00,279 --> 01:26:02,960
So shall we go ahead and eat?

1131
01:26:03,039 --> 01:26:03,960
-Yes.
-Yes.

1132
01:26:05,039 --> 01:26:06,000
Take this.

1133
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:15,600
How is it?

1134
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:16,640
Do you like it?

1135
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,439
-It's very good.
-Both the food and the eye candy.

1136
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:23,760
Pervert.

1137
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,720
I meant the view. Don't be dirty-minded.

1138
01:26:28,079 --> 01:26:29,079
Psycho.

1139
01:26:29,159 --> 01:26:30,279
Be quiet and eat.

1140
01:26:30,359 --> 01:26:31,880
Don't say such rude things.

1141
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,880
Eat this first. Don't get angry yet.

1142
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:43,760
So hangry. So mean.

1143
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:49,079
Hey!

1144
01:26:50,479 --> 01:26:51,600
Gosh.

1145
01:27:05,079 --> 01:27:07,359
-What's wrong?
-It's so spicy.

1146
01:27:07,439 --> 01:27:08,680
Are you all right?

1147
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:09,800
Is it too spicy?

1148
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:11,720
I'll get water.

1149
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:12,840
-Sure.
-Here. Try this.

1150
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:14,000
Curry.

1151
01:27:17,319 --> 01:27:18,199
Have some first.

1152
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,039
Does that help?

1153
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,680
How did you know that?

1154
01:27:29,039 --> 01:27:29,960
Coconut curry.

1155
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,199
Give your woman some.

1156
01:27:32,279 --> 01:27:36,119
Chili's spicy chemical is fat-soluble.
Coconut milk reduces the spiciness.

1157
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:38,520
It soothes the burning too.

1158
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,640
-Coconut curry.
-Eat it. You'll feel better.

1159
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:42,479
Go on.

1160
01:27:45,279 --> 01:27:47,319
-Wellâ¦
-Wellâ¦

1161
01:27:47,399 --> 01:27:49,680
Wellâ¦ we're screwed.

1162
01:27:52,119 --> 01:27:56,039
I thought everyone knew
that coconut milk cancels out spiciness.

1163
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,239
I've heard that too.

1164
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,039
And I've heard it too.

1165
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,640
Look it up. Search for it. Yeah.

1166
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,239
You know, it really does help.

1167
01:28:08,319 --> 01:28:09,520
-You see?
-Yeah.

1168
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,439
For my daughter,

1169
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:09,520
200 million isn't asking too much.

1170
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,000
Though Dad isn't thrilled,

1171
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:12,119
I'll still marry you.

1172
01:29:12,199 --> 01:29:14,560
I'll give you
one last chance to redeem yourself.

1173
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,640
Ruin Saikhim's wedding.

1174
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:18,239
Is this your wife's?

1175
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:19,520
Are you married?

1176
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:20,920
I uncovered his lie.

1177
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,359
And he said he's not divorced yet.

1178
01:29:23,439 --> 01:29:24,600
I want this divorce.

1179
01:29:25,119 --> 01:29:28,000
I can't live
with this man in my life anymore!

1180
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:30,239
He almost ruined your whole life!

1181
01:29:30,319 --> 01:29:32,920
You should at least
get marital property as compensation.

1182
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,439
The new divorce agreement.

1183
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:35,880
She wants marital property.

1184
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:37,560
So she wants to be this dog's tick.

1185
01:29:38,319 --> 01:29:41,119
Get her to talk to me face to face.
This has to end today.

1186
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:42,159
Just one night

1187
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,720
in exchange for a lifetime with him.

1188
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:45,840
Isn't it worth it?

1189
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:20,800
