THIS FICTIONAL SERIES IS INTENDED
FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY

2
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,639
This life swap

3
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:49,319
could improve both our lives, you know.

4
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,240
Lita, explain yourself right now.

5
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,280
Whose house did you put me in?

6
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,479
Well, Khim?

7
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,719
Can you hear me, Khim?

8
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,000
You know very well

9
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,400
that I hate women like your mom the most.

10
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,360
But I'm not Mom.

11
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
Don't you talk back.

12
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,800
Sidewalk!

13
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,639
Damn it!

14
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,840
Whoever dares to make you cry

15
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:23,919
is very cruel.

16
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,800
Don't let anyone make you feel worthless.

17
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,719
Don't!

18
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:39,199
Will this person always be the one?

19
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:44,360
All we can do is hold on to the days
when that person was the one.

20
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,279
Gla!

21
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,519
Gla!

22
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,759
Wake up! Don't make that stupid face.

23
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,199
You forget what you did yesterday?

24
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,120
Did you?

25
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,959
Who are you looking for?

26
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,000
Who is it?

27
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,040
Hey.

28
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,399
Go back the way you came.

29
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,319
I'm staying.

30
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,879
-Leave.
-I won't.

31
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,879
Who's there?

32
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,160
-It's not your business.
-Who's there?

33
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,399
-Hey.
-Come out right now!

34
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,879
Keep your voice down in here.

35
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,360
Are you hiding someone?

36
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,680
Come out. I said, come out!

37
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
-Be quiet.
-Come out.

38
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,079
You're not coming out?

39
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,879
I knew it, Gla.

40
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,199
You called me a skank.

41
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,839
You're just as bad.

42
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,040
It's been less than a day.

43
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,840
You've already hooked up with someone.

44
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,120
You should go now.

45
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,240
Is she conning you?

46
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,639
How long have you known her?

47
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,000
-Hey, shut up.
-Answer me.

48
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:41,759
Why? You got to beat up my man.

49
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,919
Don't protect her.

50
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,039
Why can't I beat up this girl too?

51
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,960
That's enough.

52
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,360
Hey. Come here!

53
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,519
I guess you're a spoiled brat
he got into bed.

54
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,759
You saw him driving a nice car,

55
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,440
so you let him have you?

56
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,799
Shut up.

57
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:06,240
What? Are you such a saint?

58
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,240
You're as awful as anyone.

59
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,559
And yet you left your husband
to come back here.

60
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,960
I came for my stuff.
I've seen enough of you to know better.

61
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,240
Just get out!

62
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,080
Hey! Don't forget to take your fee.

63
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,480
-Hey. Don't go.
-Hey!

64
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,919
If you don't mind sloppy seconds,
I'm happy to lease him to you.

65
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,279
If you want to get serious with him,
you should think twice,

66
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,840
or your life will be even more ruined.

67
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,360
Hey.

68
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,759
Serves you right. You ruined my life.

69
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,240
You don't get to start a new life.

70
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,279
Get out of here.
Stop ruining my life already.

71
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,200
Without me, your life'll be even worse.

72
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,120
You'll see.

73
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,039
Hey.

74
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,440
Hey, Miss… Miss what?

75
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,879
Damn. What's her name?

76
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,720
Miss!

77
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Miss, wait!

78
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,080
I said, wait.

79
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,159
Please stay. Don't go anywhere.

80
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,159
About last night…

81
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:57,919
What about it?

82
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,279
-We were drunk.
-Of course.

83
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,000
-So what?
-Listen, okay?

84
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,360
Last night, everything happened so fast.

85
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,919
But I think… I have feelings for you.

86
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,759
I can't hear you.

87
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,200
I think I like you.

88
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,840
What did you say? I can't hear you.

89
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,440
Do you get it now?

90
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,080
Miss Saikhim.

91
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,440
Your father sent me to bring you home.

92
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,440
Are you hurt, miss?

93
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:10,639
No, I'm not.

94
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,039
I'm all right.

95
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,240
Why are the police here?

96
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:24,840
If you're safe,

97
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,200
there's no problem.

98
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,879
Take Miss Khim home.
I'll take care of things here.

99
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,960
-Yes, sir.
-Go on, miss.

100
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,519
Do you own that garage?

101
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,919
Yes, sir. What about it?

102
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,720
You're a suspect
in this abduction-for-ransom case.

103
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:56,840
Ransom?

104
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:57,759
Yes.

105
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,240
That's crazy, sir.
Why would I hold her to ransom?

106
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,519
My dear Miss Khim, where have you been?

107
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,519
And why did you run off like this?

108
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,240
I've been so worried, you know that?

109
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,480
Let's go inside.

110
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,879
Where's Dad, Auntie Oon?

111
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,120
He's already left.

112
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,399
What? You're back already?

113
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,080
Where have you been, Khim?

114
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,600
We've all been worried sick.
We couldn't eat or sleep.

115
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,120
Don't pull silly stunts like this again.

116
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,200
If you hadn't come home today,

117
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,000
Seen would've died of heartbreak.

118
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,759
I'm so sorry.

119
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,399
Take her to the shower.

120
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,960
Come on, Miss Khim.

121
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,960
The brat is back.

122
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,879
She looks like a total mess.

123
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,399
It's like she wants everyone to know
what she's been up to.

124
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,159
It's unbelievable.

125
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,440
She seemed so meek.
You'd never guess she'd do this.

126
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:37,279
And poor Uncle Seen protected her so well.

127
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:43,519
Maybe she's taking after her mother.
That's why she's so disobedient.

128
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,759
History is repeating itself.

129
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,399
If your poor uncle knew, he'd be livid.

130
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,639
This is great.
I can get into his good books.

131
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,159
Maybe he'll give me the Phuket project.

132
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,360
Stay tuned for the good news, Mom.

133
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,519
Yes, dear. Come here.

134
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,639
You should take a shower.

135
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:22,879
Let me help you.

136
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:31,559
Why are your clothes so messy?

137
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,320
After your shower,
come downstairs and eat something.

138
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:40,879
I'll set the table.

139
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,360
All right?

140
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,320
Sure.

141
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,679
Search and Arrest to Patrol. Do you copy?

142
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,000
I repeat, search the crime scene.
Collect every piece of evidence.

143
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,879
Interview local witnesses. Over.
Search and Arrest. Copy. Do you copy? Out.

144
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,200
Okay. Tell me everything.

145
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,080
How many times do I have to tell you?

146
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,279
I only know that her name's Khim.

147
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:24,399
But I'm not sure if it's her real name.

148
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,440
People who meet on dating apps

149
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,240
don't always use real names, you know.

150
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,320
I don't know her that well.

151
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,759
If that's true, why was she at your place?

152
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:37,679
My ex is renting out my house
and charging by the day.

153
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,559
I just ran into Khim one day.

154
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:43,440
You're seeing her casually,
and she's renting your ex's place.

155
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,759
What does that mean?
Is this really a coincidence?

156
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,000
Serious question.

157
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,559
What's her real age?

158
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,039
You can't charge me
with kidnap of a minor.

159
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,559
I assure you that she misled me.

160
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,839
I'd say I was her victim too.

161
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,599
You forced her to ask her family
for a ransom of one million baht.

162
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,559
That's insane. I know nothing about that.

163
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:55,079
She crashed my car.

164
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,119
She claimed she would pay for the repairs.
I didn't know how she'd find the money.

165
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,839
I never even wanted that money.

166
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,359
So you're telling me

167
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,039
that you didn't unlawfully detain her
to demand a ransom, right?

168
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,799
Why would I demand a ransom?
I don't even know who her family is.

169
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,799
But you brought her to a hotel
to make a scene.

170
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:22,680
Don't tell me you didn't know

171
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:25,640
she's the hotel owner's daughter.

172
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,240
I didn't know.

173
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:34,599
I swear, I really didn't know

174
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,119
that her family was so rich.

175
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,240
Or maybe you did know

176
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:41,519
that she was the Kidakarn heiress,

177
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,200
and that's why
you pretended to flirt with her, isn't it?

178
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,079
And once you knew she was rich,
you became her lover,

179
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,720
and you lured her there to meet you.

180
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,400
So she's not some biker's chick.

181
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,200
She's a spoiled rich kid.

182
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,440
You just want me to bring the phone?
Yes, I can do that.

183
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,079
The outfit from last night?

184
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:13,680
Yes, I can bring you everything.

185
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,400
The bra and underwear too?

186
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,240
Are you hungry, Miss Khim?
I've prepared food for you.

187
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,440
I came to let you know.

188
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:29,519
Once you're dressed,
please come downstairs.

189
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,880
Last night,

190
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,319
you two were at the garage.

191
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,920
Do you often bring strangers to your home?

192
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,440
We got on well,
so we talked for a long time.

193
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,200
You got on well.

194
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:00,680
But you don't know her real name.

195
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,240
Drunk people aren't known
for having rational conversations.

196
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,960
What were you doing all night?

197
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:13,640
I passed out.

198
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,440
I can't remember when.

199
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:20,640
Once we get the physical exam results,

200
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,359
we will see
how reliable your statements are.

201
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,000
To make sure, why not take my DNA sample?

202
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,160
Good idea.

203
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,680
So we'll know what to charge you with.

204
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:38,359
Unlawful detention,

205
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,880
extortion,

206
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,680
or sexual assault.

207
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,000
Or maybe you did all of them.
So that's fine with me.

208
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:56,319
We got on well,
so we talked for a long time.

209
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,079
You got on well.

210
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,319
But you don't know her real name.

211
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,319
Drunk people aren't known
for having rational conversations.

212
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,200
What were you doing all night?

213
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,279
I passed out. I can't remember when.

214
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,079
That man denied all the accusations.

215
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,319
He's been released.

216
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:20,000
I've checked Miss Khim's phone.
There were no messages to or from him.

217
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,480
Should I take her to the hospital
for a physical exam?

218
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,160
No.

219
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,799
It's time I tried trusting
the daughter I raised myself.

220
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,759
But watch Saikhim closely.

221
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,000
Don't let her contact such men again.

222
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,839
Even better, make them disappear
from her life completely.

223
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,079
You said you didn't like dating apps.

224
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,200
How did she get you into bed?

225
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:01,319
How dare you give me attitude?

226
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,119
This is your fault.
You flirted irresponsibly.

227
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,079
I almost went to jail for abducting her.

228
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:09,519
Well, how could I have known
that she was so rich?

229
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,039
You should be happy, bro.

230
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:14,759
She's way out of your league,
but you got lucky for once.

231
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:18,559
I hope that some day,
I'll be someone's lover too.

232
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,039
That girl is more like
my nemesis from a past life.

233
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:22,480
Don't you understand?

234
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,000
I could go to prison.

235
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:26,720
But she consented, right?

236
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,799
You didn't force her or anything.

237
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:31,039
You're missing the point.

238
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,200
If the police come sniffing around here,

239
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:37,480
and they see this evidence,
what else would they charge me with?

240
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:43,680
You should finish stamping
that vehicle identification number.

241
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,720
Deliver that car before the cops show up,
or I'll get pinned with more charges.

242
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:48,640
Go on.

243
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,319
Don't tell me

244
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:30,400
you didn't know
she's the hotel owner's daughter.

245
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,599
And once you knew she was rich,
you became her lover,

246
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,759
and you lured her there to meet you.

247
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,200
I guess you're a spoiled brat
he got into bed.

248
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,000
You saw him driving a nice car,

249
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:43,759
so you let him have you?

250
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,640
Shut up.

251
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:51,680
What? Are you such a saint?
You're as awful as anyone.

252
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,039
Your father sent me to bring you home.
Are you hurt, miss?

253
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,640
Will the rich kid be punished?

254
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,359
Why do I care? I should save myself first.

255
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,960
Did Dad get home already?

256
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:32,839
Yes, miss.

257
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,240
Wait, miss.

258
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,000
He's on a video conference
with overseas colleagues.

259
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,880
He can't see you right now.

260
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,319
We both live here
but don't see each other.

261
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,000
Yet the other side of the world sees him.

262
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:51,200
I think he's actually avoiding me.

263
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,759
Are you still mad at me?

264
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:03,799
Is that why you're avoiding me?

265
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,400
I don't have the time

266
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,720
to do stupid things like you do.

267
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,920
Actually, you're still mad at me.

268
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,559
You're bringing feelings into this?

269
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,119
You don't even dare to look me in the eye.

270
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:41,359
That's how I know you're still mad at me.

271
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:47,200
You can't keep pretending I don't exist.

272
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,720
Who was it

273
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,079
who tried to run away?

274
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,119
Who was it`

275
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,920
who cared about him and not about me?

276
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:05,559
The crook wants cash.

277
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:10,039
He's not a crook, Dad.

278
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,319
That money…

279
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,880
I asked for it just to test you.

280
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,680
How has he fooled you? How?
Why are you protecting him like this?

281
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,359
He hasn't fooled me.

282
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,359
You don't understand.

283
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,920
If he's such a good person,

284
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,200
why was he in juvenile detention?

285
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,559
Whom are you talking about?

286
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,359
The person you ran off with.

287
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:41,720
He's an ex-con.

288
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,519
He's a criminal.

289
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,240
He went to prison for assaulting someone.

290
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,079
You really can't tell?

291
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,279
So much for those good grades.

292
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,640
You almost got fooled by him.

293
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,759
He's been

294
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:59,799
in prison?

295
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,720
You see?

296
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,440
Because of your insolence,

297
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,960
you almost got fooled by him.

298
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:07,480
Wouldn't you be mad too?

299
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,319
I'm your father. I want the best for you.

300
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,640
But you don't listen to me.

301
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,799
You listen to that ex-con instead.

302
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,839
Go and stay in Phuket.

303
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,359
Don't let him get close to you.

304

The person you ran off with.

He's an ex-con.

307
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,039
He's a criminal.

You really can't tell?

309
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,440

SAIKHIM KIDAKARN,
A PRECOCIOUS BILLION-BAHT HEIRESS

312
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,599
Billion-baht heiress?

313
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,839
I'm an idiot.

314
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,799
Why didn't I suspect anything?

315
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,000
They've resorted to this?

316
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,480
Miss Khim, let's buy some snacks.

317
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:03,039
Come on. What would you like to eat?

318
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:06,119
-What would you like?
-I'll get you something.

319
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,720
-That looks delicious.
-Hi.

320

SANGUAN PHARMACY

321
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:11,200
-Which would you like?
-These ones.

322
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,720
All right.

323
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,440
Or maybe these ones.

How may I help you?

327
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,279
You can ask me anything.

328
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:02,880
Here.

329
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,880
I see.

330
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,960
-These pills--
-Miss Khim?

331
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:10,279
What are you doing?

332
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,480
I came to buy motion sickness pills.

333
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,920
My dear, you should have asked me.

334
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,960
I brought some.

335
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:21,839
I've got everything in my bag.

336
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,039
-I'm sorry. We already have some.
-It's okay.

337
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,319
Let's go.

338
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,880
Back from your honeymoon?

339
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:07,680
You were with your lover, right?

340
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:09,119
I don't have a lover.

341
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,079
It's natural to have one.

342
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,480
Raging hormones. I understand.

343
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,480
But you should have better taste.

344
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,480
You know very well

345
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,000
that your dad is a snob.

346
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:30,519
You debased yourself with that lowlife,

347
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:33,720
so it serves you right
that you're being grounded here.

348
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:37,440
Wait, Khim.

349
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,640
Next time,

350
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,960
if you want a good guy,

351
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:40,880
let me know.

352
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:43,240
I'll find you one.

353
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:53,640
I heard Saikhim misbehaved so much
you had to fly here earlier.

354
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:55,519
What a shame.

355
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:59,200
I don't mind. I'm just worried about her.

356
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,000
Uncle Seen sent her to Phuket.

357
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,640
She's on probation.

358
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,759
So Khim is in Phuket now?

359
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,559
Yes. She might be there for a while,
until Uncle Seen can trust her again.

360
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,920
Girls with overprotective dads don't know
how to cope with men.

361
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,039
-Men?
-Hey.

362
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,320
Tan, do you really think
Khim came back because of her friend?

363
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,559
She's very sneaky.
The house-swapping story is a cover.

364
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:32,960
The truth is she probably just wanted
to come back to see her boyfriend.

365
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:37,440
Please excuse me.

366
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,159
I've never met that man, sir.

367
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,199
We've only talked via the app.

368
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,039
He lives in the area
near the house I rented,

369
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:58,719
and I wanted to introduce him to Saikhim

370
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,360
so she'd have
a friend to hang out with in Thailand.

371
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,960
And how do you know Saikhim?

372
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,519
Mr. Seen,
she's in that program you sponsor.

373
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:13,280
Every year, you contribute
tuition fees and presents.

374
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,599
And I organize rewards for good grades.

375
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:20,760
Miss Khim happened to see me
preparing those presents.

376
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,159
-Miss.
-Yes?

377
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:30,079
Do you like it?

378
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:34,719
Whose is it?

379
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,880
At first, Miss Khim thought
you had a secret love child,

380
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:44,280
so I explained that you sponsored
another child via the foundation.

381
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,960
In that case, let's give this to her.

382
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:48,800
I already have so many.

383
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,840
I'll take that one instead.

384
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,840
This one, miss?

385
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,760
I was so happy, sir,

386
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:57,440
that you gave me that expensive stuff,

387
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:59,800
so I wrote you letters to thank you.

388
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,840
But I guess you never got them

389
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,679
because Saikhim answered them all herself.

390
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,639
Ever since, Miss Khim said
that whatever birthday gift she got,

391
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:12,199
she wanted to give the same gift
to this sponsored child too.

392
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:16,400
Saikhim and I stayed in touch
via email for years.

393
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,480
Neither of us knew whom the other was

394
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,920
until Saikhim moved to my school.

395
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,920
We have been friends ever since.

396
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,639
So that's why you have the gall
to take advantage and steal her identity.

397
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,239
It's not like that.

398
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,239
You see, the two of us agreed
to swap houses

399
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,719
to find out what it would be like
to live different lives.

400
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,119
If you lie down with dogs,

401
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,519
you get up with fleas.

402
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:45,760
Isn't that the expression?

403
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,480
May I be frank with you, sir?

404
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:51,239
I used to really envy Saikhim

405
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:53,880
for having you as a dad.

406
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:58,000
But as our friendship grew over time,
I stopped envying her

407
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,320
because she has a life

408
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:01,880
that isn't truly lived.

409
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:03,719
She has everything,

410
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,480
but she's unhappy,

411
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:07,159
so she needs friends like me.

412
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,880
Thank you, sir.

413
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:20,400
Mr. Seen is canceling your scholarship.

414
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,480
If you keep contacting Miss Khim,

415
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,480
we'll make sure you stop.

416
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:32,480
Don't you feel guilty yet?

417
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,039
Why should I feel guilty?
I didn't trick anyone.

418
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,119
You should have known
that what you did was wrong.

419
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,199
Maybe Khim is too innocent

420
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,320
to realize you're a phony.

421
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,239
My word.

422
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,280
You rich people,

423
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,679
you're so good at bitching…
I mean, insulting people.

424
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,679
Let me tell you something.

425
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,920
Khim's never been interested in you, dude.

426
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:06,360
If she were, I'd have heard her
gushing over Mr. Tantai.

427
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,519
Hey. Go back where you came from.

428
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,400
Stop looking around.

429
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:27,119
Khim isn't here.

430
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:57,800
Miss Khim.

431
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,280
Guess who turned up.

432
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:06,960
Tan.

433
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,199
I heard that you were here,
so I came to see you.

434
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:16,960
Dad was afraid I'd go out
and do more stupid things,

435
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:19,199
so he's grounded me here.

436
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,679
So, is something wrong, Khim?

437
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,719
Why did you run off like this?

438
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,119
I just wanted to live
like other people do.

439
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,000
But if you get lonely,
you can talk to me at any time, okay?

440
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:41,199
Hey, wanna go diving with me today?

441
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,239
I'll take you diving.

442
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,760
I don't know

443
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,360
if Dad would let me.

444
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,239
Auntie Oon?

445
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,880
May I go out on a boat with Tan?

446
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,840
Won't you wait for Mr. Seen first?

447
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,719
Auntie Oon, tell Mr. Seen not to worry.

448
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,760
I'll bring Khim back very soon.

449
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,039
I promise not to let her
do anything stupid.

450
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,360
-Come on.
-Then I'll come too.

451
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:15,760
It's okay, Auntie Oon.

452
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,960
Stay here and prepare dinner.
I'll be back this evening.

453
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:33,960
Tan?

454
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:36,280
I need to buy motion sickness pills.

455
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,800
-Sure.
-I'll be quick.

456
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,400
Who came to the garage?

457
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,679
Did they say who they were?

458
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:50,159
Good job moving that stuff in time.

459
00:40:57,159 --> 00:41:00,000
Find out why they came.
I'll take care of the problem.

460
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,480
How can I help you this time?

461
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,920
Birth control again?

462
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,639
How long has it been
since you slept together?

463
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:24,079
Over 72 hours?

464
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:32,280
It's okay. I can help.

465
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,639
Take one of these pills immediately.

466
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:37,800
Take another one 12 hours later, okay?

467
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,239
This other product is new.
You only have to take one.

468
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,400
Which would you like?

469
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:45,360
-All of them.
-It's 60 baht per box, okay?

470
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,760
That's 240 baht for four boxes.

471
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,719
So there you are.

472
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,920
Let's talk right now.

473
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,800
Hey. You followed me here?

474
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,079
You gave me trouble.
Why'd you get me arrested?

475
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,639
Wait. You dropped your stuff.

476
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:47,360
Are you done, Khim?

477
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,199
-All done, Tan.
-Where are the pills?

478
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I took them already.

479
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:52,239
We should go.

480
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,239
Bro, they're going through the cameras.

481
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:25,679
They're even taking the CCTV
from our clients' cars.

482
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,840
Luckily, I was prepared.

483
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,800
I already removed our CCTV's hard disk,

484
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,360
so they won't see
your videos from that night.

485
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,400
So she must have told them something.

486
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,079
I'll take care of this.

487
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:39,480
Hey.

488
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,360
Give me that.

489
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,400
Sir, stop.

490
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,920
Follow that car.

491
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,400
Stop. Stop right here.

492
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:43,079
The troublemaker's still walking free.

493
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:51,880
Do you need help? All right. Come on.

494
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:54,239
Wanna get changed? Come with me.

495
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,639
-Sure.
-Come on.

496
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,079
It'll be just me and her today.

497
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,079
Please tidy the kitchen.

498
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,440
Yes, sir.

499
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:49,079
Hey.

500
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,679
You… how did you get in here?

501
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:58,000
I came to see
how you manage to move on so happily.

502
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,800
You followed me all the way from Bangkok?

503
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,519
Hey. Did you tell anyone about that night?

504
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,880
What about that night?

505
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:08,840
You're making me say it?

506
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,239
That night that we…

507
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,000
that we…

508
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:13,960
that we did it.

509
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:16,400
Are you crazy?

510
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:19,280
I didn't tell anyone. Why would I?

511
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,079
The cops accused me
of luring and assaulting you.

512
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:26,559
So you came here to harass me?

513
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,480
Wait. Harass you? Watch what you say.

514
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:32,719
Hey! Watch out!

515
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,519
Look, you followed me everywhere.
Isn't that harassment?

516
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:02,719
I didn't harass you.

517
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,920
And I didn't lure you.

518
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,119
You know you were willing that day.

519
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:09,599
No.

520
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:10,880
I wasn't willing.

521
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,599
I see. So that's why, isn't it?

522
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:15,280
That's why they've come after me.

523
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,199
That night, I was drunk.

524
00:47:19,159 --> 00:47:21,679
How could I know
things would end up that way?

525
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,519
We were equally drunk.
How can you blame it all on me?

526
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,920
I didn't tell anyone.
You're the one who acts suspicious.

527
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,239
Khim? What are you doing?

528
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,840
Khim?

529
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:42,199
Tan, I--

530
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:46,440
Don't tell--

531
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:48,199
I'm getting changed, Tan.

532
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:50,480
Well, if you need anything, ask me.

533
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,519
Yes, Tan, I--

534
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:59,079
-What are you doing?
-What? Hey--

535
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:00,760
I'll be right there, Tan.

536
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,880
Let go of my hand.

537
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,239
I don't even want to touch you.

538
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,800
So stop bothering me.

539
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,679
So tell the cops to leave me alone.
Drop the charges first.

540
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,840
Ask yourself
if you've got anything on your conscience.

541
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,559
If you don't have a record,
no one should suspect you.

542
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:32,639
Where are you going?

543
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:33,760
Let's talk properly.

544
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,800
Khim, are you all right?

545
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:45,480
I was asking him

546
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:48,159
which coral reef we were going to.

547
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,039
Would you like a drink?

548
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:53,639
Yes. Sure.

549
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,559
What do we have?

550
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,360
Drinking water. We have drinking water.

551
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:07,719
It's nice and safe.

552
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:16,159
Khim, let's go and enjoy the view.

553
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,079
-Let's go.
-Come on.

554
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:38,400
Nice weather, right?

555
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:40,079
Yes.

556
00:49:42,039 --> 00:49:42,880
Come down here.

557
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:46,239
-Come here first.
-No. Go away.

558
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,400
You come here.

559
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:50,880
Hello?

560
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:54,280
I set off a while ago. Yes, there is.

561
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,920
There's one attendant here.

562
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,000
He's not an employee?

563
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,920
What? If he isn't, why is he on my yacht?

564
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:07,679
You have to go right now.

565
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:10,920
I'll ask him myself
why he got on my yacht.

566
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:23,400
Hurry.

567
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:27,840
Hey, come here.

568
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:30,639
Listen.

569
00:50:31,719 --> 00:50:34,800
Leave the yacht right now.
We can't let them see us together.

570
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,280
I'm not going until you promise
to settle this with your dad.

571
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,679
I already told you
that I never told anyone.

572
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:45,239
Even if you didn't, here's the evidence.

573
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,239
What woman takes these
when she hasn't slept with a man?

574
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,199
Well? You're going to land me in prison.

575
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,400
-Hey, give me those.
-No.

576
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:58,119
-Hey, give them to me.
-I won't. No.

577
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,320
We're already in deep trouble,
you know that?

578
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,039
Give them to me.

579
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:05,159
Promise me first.

580
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:19,599
Yes, Mr. Sansern?

581
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,079
Yes, I know we have a stowaway.

582
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,599
I haven't found him yet.

583
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,239
Sure, I'll check the deck again.

584
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:33,519
I beg you.

585
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:36,360
Can you find a way to leave the yacht

586
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,400
so that things don't get worse, please?

587
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,239
Where can I go? We're at sea.

588
00:51:42,039 --> 00:51:43,119
Just jump in.

589
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:45,760
-Are you nuts?
-I'm not kidding.

590
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,760
-Go!
-Are you trying to kill me?

591
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:51,960
I can't help it. You asked for trouble.

592
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:54,159
If my dad knew that you followed me,

593
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,199
you'd be sorry.

594
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,920
-I'm not going.
-What?

595
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,679
Khim?

596
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,800
-Khim?
-He's here. Tan is here.

597
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,159
Do you want to die or what?
I told you to jump.

598
00:52:07,239 --> 00:52:08,679
Are you trying to kill me?

599
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,000
-You have to go now!
-What?

600
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:10,920
Khim?

601
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:12,840
-Jump!
-I won't jump.

602
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,079
That's too bad.

603
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:16,960
Hey!

604
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:32,519
Khim?

605
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:35,159
-Yes?
-Have you seen the guy who came with us?

606
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:38,760
Not for a while, no.

607
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,239
He followed us on purpose.
He might be a con man.

608
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:46,719
-Really?
-The guards are coming to detain him.

609
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:51,119
Hello?

610
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:53,039
Sure.

611
00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:16,719
Please don't die.

612
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,440
Congratulations.

613
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:27,079
You survived.

614
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,000
I don't think this is the end of it.

615
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,480
I'm so sorry we didn't see this coming.

616
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,039
-Did you find the suspect?
-Perhaps within an hour.

617
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:13,199
It would be a miracle
if he could swim for longer than that.

618
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:15,599
-Thank you.
-Sir.

619
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:25,880
Khim?

620
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,519
Don't be afraid. The police will get him.

621
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:33,119
-Right.
-Let's go.

622
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,440
Were there any problems?

623
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:43,679
No, sir. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

624
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:45,679
Please keep an eye out.

625
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,480
-He has fair skin and is about my height.
-Yes, sir.

626
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:50,400
Wait.

627
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,920
Where are you going?

628
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,920
When you land today,
you're supposed to report to the office.

629
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,000
Did you hear me?

630
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:04,360
I told you to report to the office.

631
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,599
Why haven't you fetched the car?

632
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,599
What are you waiting for?

633
00:56:37,639 --> 00:56:39,079
Why is this car with you?

634
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:41,639
It's been mine since I was in England.

635
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:45,920
It was stolen
and given someone else's number plates.

636
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:50,400
I had to travel the world
to get this car back.

637
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:56,199
Imagine the pain of a mother
who is separated from her beloved child.

638
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,760
You understand that pain, don't you?

639
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:03,559
Who are you exactly?

640
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,280
I suppose I'm not the only one

641
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,400
you've caused trouble for.

642
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,639
Are you an informant?

643
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,639
I just want to say
that you owe me your life.

644
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:31,880
If I hadn't saved you,

645
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,639
you might have died by now.

646
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:36,360
Anyway,

647
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,360
as for the rest of your life,

648
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,440
will you give it to me or to them?

649
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:14,400
My poor Miss Khim, you must be so shaken.

650
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,920
At least you weren't
on the yacht alone with that intruder.

651
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,280
The rescue divers are searching for him.
They should be done tonight.

652
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:29,559
Dangerous people like him should get
the most severe punishment.

653
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:31,400
Hopefully, he won't die first.

654
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:36,519
Tan,

655
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:39,599
is there really no way
to get from there back to shore?

656
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:43,239
Well, it's risky
if you don't have flotation devices.

657
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:54,840
Damn. Are they informants for the cops?

658
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,599
If they were, I wouldn't be free now.

659
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,119
If I'm caught this time,
I'll surely go to prison.

660
00:59:00,199 --> 00:59:03,079
Bro, things are looking bad here too.

661
00:59:03,159 --> 00:59:05,960
They managed to get our CCTV hard disk.

662
00:59:06,039 --> 00:59:08,559
What if they report on us
just to punish you

663
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:10,840
for popping his daughter's cherry?

664
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:12,840
Are they the Mafia?

665
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,000
Did I sleep with the Godfather's daughter?

666
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,159
What should we do?
They took all the evidence.

667
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,239
Are they trying to make me disappear?

668
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:31,320
Khem, try to find more information.

669
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,519
What businesses do the Kidakarns own here?

670
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:35,800
I won't be their sitting duck.

671
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,599
Yeah. All right.

672
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:26,360
The AC unit is this way.

673
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:48,760
Any updates?

674
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,119
Did you find the suspect?

675
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:56,280
You have my permission
to search the yacht for evidence anytime.

676
01:00:57,239 --> 01:00:58,719
And if you detain the suspect,

677
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,559
I'm happy to identify him.

678
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:13,400
I never wanted to kill anyone.

679
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:15,440
Please be okay.

680
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:16,599
You have to survive.

681
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,280
Please survive.

682
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,519
Miss Khim, I noticed
that the AC wasn't working.

683
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,280
The unit is going to be cleaned.

684
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,519
Of course. Please go ahead.

685
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:44,000
I'll open it.

686
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,199
Please come in.

687
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:53,599
Be thorough.

688
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:57,559
We need it to work since it's summer.
Check everything carefully.

689
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,679
When you're done, find me downstairs.

690
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:01,599
-Sure.
-Good.

691
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:10,639
It's getting late.
They might call off the search.

692
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:12,079
Right.

693
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,159
It's lucky no one got hurt.

694
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,199
So, Khim,

695
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,719
are you still frightened?

696
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:35,239
Well, I won't rest easy until we find him.

697
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:38,079
Awful, isn't it?

698
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:40,679
Why are there
such shady characters around these days?

699
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:43,159
This is why
you shouldn't look for trouble.

700
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,280
You can't trust anyone these days.

701
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,320
It's finished.

702
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,119
All right. Wait a second.

703
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:13,800
What a nice life.

704
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,760
She's an actual princess.

705
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Sinner.

706
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:36,719
Wait. You're not dead?

707
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,159
I… I didn't mean to do it.

708
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:41,000
I'm sorry that you didn't kill me.

709
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,519
You really survived?

710
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:47,599
You can't kill me that easily.
I can't let you get away with it.

711
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,159
Wait. How did you get in here?
What if you get caught?

712
01:03:52,679 --> 01:03:53,800
Since I survived,

713
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,719
I might as well check out
how rich people live.

714
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,199
You have to go, or you'll get caught.

715
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,119
At least I won't be alone this time.

716
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:04,000
We'll go down together.

717
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,480
I thought they came to clean the AC.

718
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,519
But they actually installed spy cameras.

719
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:18,719
For keeping an eye on you, I guess.

720
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,559
Are you on vacation, or are you in prison?

721
01:04:26,199 --> 01:04:27,599
My dad resorted to this?

722
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:31,079
It will be even worse
if he sees what's on that hard disk.

723
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:32,760
What hard disk?

724
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,480
The CCTV hard disk
from the garage that night.

725
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,000
If there's a camera,

726
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:42,119
Dad will see--

727
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:44,760
If you don't want to kill us both,
go get those files.

728
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:48,719
If he sees our videos,
you might never leave this room again.

729
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:34,320
They must have put
the CCTV files in there.

730
01:05:35,559 --> 01:05:37,559
His spies have watched
the garage for days.

731
01:05:37,639 --> 01:05:40,519
Once they knew I was gone,
they barged in and seized everything.

732
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:43,000
I bet they'll pin charges on me.

733
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:48,119
Sweet-talk your dad.

734
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,039
Get all the evidence.

735
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:51,800
Don't sabotage my future.

736
01:06:02,519 --> 01:06:03,360
Dad?

737
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,360
Is this a good time to talk?

738
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,679
Why?

739
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,199
I want to watch a movie with you.

740
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,320
Sure.

741
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:38,559
Which one should we watch?

742
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,960
I think you should pick one.

743
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:49,760
Here.

744
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,360
That looks good.

745
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:08,079
It's the sequel of that other one we saw.

746
01:07:11,639 --> 01:07:12,559
Are you sure

747
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:14,960
you want me to choose?

748
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:19,519
Any movie is good
if I get to watch it with you.

749
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,559
What about this one?

750
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,920
Don't think I don't know

751
01:07:41,719 --> 01:07:43,360
about the lies you've told me.

752
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:47,519
You've behaved recklessly and hopelessly.

753
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:54,039
What's so good about him
that you can't resist?

754
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:56,559
Do you like
how he recorded this to expose you?

755
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:58,480
Is this the life you want?

756
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:00,840
This disgusting life?

757
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:03,960
You slut.

758
01:08:05,639 --> 01:08:06,760
You're good-for-nothing.

759
01:08:11,719 --> 01:08:13,800
What? Are you embarrassed?

760
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:15,480
You weren't then.

761
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:20,840
And today, on the yacht,

762
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,720
don't think I don't know it was him.

763
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:24,880
The CCTV

764
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,319
recorded him hanging around that area.

765
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,239
You knew it was him,
but you didn't tell Tantai.

766
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:31,920
You brought him on the yacht.

767
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,800
That attached to him, are you?

768
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:37,279
How did he do this to you?

769
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:40,600
What did I do wrong
to make you turn out like this?

770
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,439
Saikhim didn't know I followed her.

771
01:08:49,479 --> 01:08:50,479
What does he mean?

772
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:52,880
Did you bring him here?

773
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:53,920
No, I came here.

774
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,840
Enough. That's enough. Please stop.

775
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:01,920
Get away.

776
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:04,319
Why did you trick her?

777
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,239
I didn't trick her.

778
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:09,039
You mean she's stupid enough
to just believe you?

779
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,760
You raised her, but you can't tell?

780
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,319
She feels nothing for me.

781
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:14,800
She hates me.

782
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,880
She insults me,
and she'd even kill me.

783
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,039
She's not in love with me.

784
01:09:20,119 --> 01:09:21,840
Then why'd you dare mess with her?

785
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:23,920
You dragged me into this.

786
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,840
You came after me.

787
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:28,079
You act like you're so superior.

788
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,560
But you're such a disaster

789
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,000
that she lost faith in you.

790
01:09:32,079 --> 01:09:33,399
What did you say?

791
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:35,279
She hates herself when she's with you.

792
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,640
You never make anyone feel good enough.

793
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,119
She didn't fall for any man.

794
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:45,079
She just feels good about herself
when she's with someone else.

795
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,119
Have you ever made her like herself
like when she's with me?

796
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:57,960
You've gone too far!

797
01:09:58,039 --> 01:09:59,960
Dad!

798
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:01,600
Stop. Please stop.

799
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:02,600
-Dad--
-Get off.

800
01:10:06,199 --> 01:10:10,159
Dad! Stop! Dad, that's enough.

801
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,880
It's not his fault. He did nothing wrong.

802
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,760
I was the one who went to him.

803
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,199
Dad, look at this. Do you see this?

804
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:22,239
It's not his fault.
I went to see him. Do you see?

805
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:23,159
That's enough!

806
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:25,640
That's enough.

807
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:30,520
Have you lost your mind?

808
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:32,760
He didn't try to trick me.

809
01:10:34,119 --> 01:10:36,279
He opened my eyes to the truth.

810
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:39,920
Opened your eyes?

811
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,960
Think he's sincere with you, do you?

812
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:50,439
If you didn't use the Kidakarn name,

813
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:53,319
what man would be interested in you?

814
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:55,479
Remember this.

815
01:10:56,399 --> 01:11:01,199
No man would be interested in you
if you didn't have my fortune!

816
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,039
Get out.

817
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:14,960
Get the hell out!

818
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:16,239
Stay out of my life.

819
01:11:21,439 --> 01:11:22,279
Go!

820
01:12:05,159 --> 01:12:06,159
You dare show up here?

821
01:12:08,039 --> 01:12:09,800
-Why are you here?
-To see my girl.

822
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,560
You scumbag.

823
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:14,479
Prom!

824
01:12:15,119 --> 01:12:15,960
Take him away!

825
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:18,560
Come on.

826
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:21,359
Prom, what are you doing?

827
01:12:23,159 --> 01:12:24,359
Prom, don't!

828
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:27,960
Prom!

829
01:12:28,479 --> 01:12:31,279
-Get away!
-Why isn't he moving? Is he okay?

830
01:12:33,239 --> 01:12:35,439
Prom, what are you going to do?

831
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:36,920
Prom!

832
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:39,600
Prom!

833
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,600
That's enough!

834
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,319
Gla!

835
01:12:52,119 --> 01:12:53,239
Prom, that's enough!

836
01:12:55,159 --> 01:12:56,680
Who do you think you are?

837
01:12:58,039 --> 01:12:59,159
Your cousin-in-law?

838
01:13:02,279 --> 01:13:03,439
Prom!

839
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:06,479
That's enough, Prom!

840
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:09,000
Dad!

841
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,439
You're letting Prom kill him?

842
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,319
Tell him to stop!

843
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:16,840
When he humiliated me, you didn't care.

844
01:13:20,199 --> 01:13:22,000
You dare call me cousin again?

845
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,800
See? See what a scumbag he is?

846
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:34,640
Isn't what you're doing just as barbaric?
You're treating him like he's not human.

847
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:36,960
Prom, that's enough!

848
01:13:42,039 --> 01:13:43,319
-Prom, enough--
-Why?

849
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,880
Why are you so desperate
to save this scum?

850
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:49,000
Don't you know
he wants five million for the video?

851
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:52,079
It's not true.

852
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:57,159
He was going to blackmail you.
I had to pay five million for the video.

853
01:13:58,039 --> 01:13:59,119
It's not true!

854
01:14:05,319 --> 01:14:08,279
He already took the five million,
but he's still messing with you.

855
01:14:08,359 --> 01:14:09,840
Isn't five million enough?

856
01:14:11,039 --> 01:14:12,239
He held you hostage,

857
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:14,560
and he manipulated us to make us fall out

858
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,439
so you'd see me negatively.

859
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:18,000
Liar!

860
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,880
-Liar!
-Shut up!

861
01:14:22,279 --> 01:14:23,119
I'm the liar?

862
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,399
I've been with you all your life.

863
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,439
Who is he? How well do you know him?

864
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,920
You still can't see how deceptive he is?

865
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,560
Now will you leave my cousin alone?

866
01:14:39,239 --> 01:14:40,479
Stop using women's cash!

867
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,319
Enough! That's enough.

868
01:15:04,119 --> 01:15:05,520
Let's end things here.

869
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,439
It's not worth it for either of us.

870
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,399
Just pretend that we've never met.

871
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:16,000
Let's not ruin our lives even more.

872
01:15:24,439 --> 01:15:25,359
Did you hear that?

873
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,520
That's how much you disgust her.

874
01:15:30,039 --> 01:15:31,600
Get out of Saikhim's life

875
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:34,000
if you still want to live.

876
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:41,079
You really think I'm that disgraceful?

877
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:49,560
You said you'd give your life to me,
so why are you about to die again?

878
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,399
I've had bad luck with women lately.

879
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:54,000
Come with me, and we'll make our own luck.

880
01:17:19,119 --> 01:17:20,119
FIVE MILLION BAHT

881
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:30,760
Khem.

882
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,039
You had the check?

883
01:17:35,239 --> 01:17:37,319
It's your fee
for leaving his daughter alone.

884
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,840
They left it when they took the CCTV.

885
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,720
Why the hell did you accept it?

886
01:17:43,319 --> 01:17:44,600
-Damn it!
-Bro, calm down!

887
01:17:45,319 --> 01:17:47,199
Bro! Hey!

888
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,880
Do you think it's worth
what I've been through?

889
01:17:52,479 --> 01:17:56,000
Well, who said you had to go alone
and let them destroy you?

890
01:17:56,079 --> 01:17:57,479
You think you're a pro boxer?

891
01:17:58,079 --> 01:17:59,159
If I take this money,

892
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,800
it means I admit
that I really wanted to use her for money.

893
01:18:04,439 --> 01:18:06,880
Just think of it
as compensation for your injuries.

894
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,319
Would you really sacrifice
your honor for money?

895
01:18:12,039 --> 01:18:14,600
Is it different
from how we work for rich people's money?

896
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,800
We make money
from these sinners' obsessions.

897
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,039
But this check was earned
when we ruined a good woman's future.

898
01:18:22,119 --> 01:18:26,399
While that poor girl protected me,
you rubbed salt in my wounds.

899
01:18:26,479 --> 01:18:29,439
If you didn't take the check,
her dad wouldn't like you anyway.

900
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:32,800
But at least Saikhim wouldn't look
like she got conned by a man.

901
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:36,319
She'd be a beloved daughter
who could face up to her dad.

902
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,279
This five-million-baht check

903
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,000
could ruin her life.

904
01:18:41,279 --> 01:18:43,680
She doesn't deserve
to be pitied because of me.

905
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,880
Mr. Seen is canceling your scholarship.

906
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,960
If you keep contacting Miss Khim,

907
01:18:57,479 --> 01:18:59,000
we'll make sure that you stop.

908
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,079
-Khim?
-Lita!

909
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:06,520
-Lita!
-Khim, get out!

910
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:07,560
-Khim!
-Lita!

911
01:19:17,479 --> 01:19:18,920
SHARING IS CARING ROTI

912
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:45,239
Dad! Stop! Dad, that's enough.

913
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:46,359
It's not his fault.

914
01:19:46,439 --> 01:19:48,079
I was the one who went to him.

915
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:54,800
Enough! That's enough.

916
01:20:47,119 --> 01:20:49,079
New member.

917
01:20:49,159 --> 01:20:50,359
Awesome.

918
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:00,039
-I think I'm pregnant.
-What?

919
01:21:00,119 --> 01:21:01,720
If I'm really pregnant,

920
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,319
what can I do, Lita?

921
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:04,840
Wait, Khim.

922
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,479
Try to stay calm.

923
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,520
How can you be pregnant? Whose is it?

924
01:21:10,039 --> 01:21:13,880
Well, you know how we swapped houses?

925
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:19,199
Don't tell me you got pregnant
with one of the guys I picked on the app.

926
01:21:23,119 --> 01:21:23,960
Lita.

927
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,560
If I'm really pregnant,

928
01:21:27,319 --> 01:21:28,880
my dad will definitely kill me.

929
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,479
Maybe it won't be that bad.

930
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:32,640
Stay calm for now.

931
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,239
Dad watches my every move, Lita.

932
01:21:40,199 --> 01:21:43,399
I'm so stressed out.

933
01:21:43,479 --> 01:21:44,840
Can you help me, Lita?

934
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,880
I want to know if I'm really pregnant.

935
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:50,600
Okay, Khim, I'm about to finish my shift.

936
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,520
Can you discreetly come and see me?

937
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:55,960
Don't freak out. Let's make sure first.
Stay calm, I'll be there soon.

938
01:21:56,039 --> 01:21:57,079
Okay.

939
01:22:01,239 --> 01:22:02,079
Is this real?

940
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,119
What have I done?

941
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:22,720
The steam room, please.

942
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:10,239
What do I do now?

943
01:23:11,039 --> 01:23:13,319
Why is this happening to me?

944
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:21,319
Try to stay calm, Khim.

945
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:33,800
Wanna do another test?

946
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:36,880
Just in case.

947
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:47,279
I never should have let this happen, Lita.

948
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:52,000
-How could I let this happen?
-It's not your fault, Khim.

949
01:23:54,199 --> 01:23:57,920
It's my fault.
I brought those men into your life.

950
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:05,880
I should have seen through them.

951
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:10,760
Now we're in this mess.

952
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:19,800
Lita.

953
01:24:22,119 --> 01:24:23,159
I'm scared.

954
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:27,359
If my dad knew,

955
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:31,199
he'd definitely kill me, Lita.

956
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:32,920
He doesn't have to know.

957
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:35,680
We…

958
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:38,199
we'll figure this out together.

959
01:24:38,279 --> 01:24:40,319
We can figure this out together.

960
01:24:43,239 --> 01:24:44,079
Okay?

961
01:24:47,079 --> 01:24:47,920
Okay?

962
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:56,920
I share the blame.

963
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:01,520
I'll help you take care of it.

964
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:04,039
Don't be scared, Khim.

965
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:11,840
Hey.

966
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:15,479
Are you Saikhim's friend?

967
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:18,000
So you're here. What do you want?

968
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:19,520
Can I have Saikhim's number?

969
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,800
Damn you. Who do you think you are?

970
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,359
So you know about us?

971
01:26:24,439 --> 01:26:26,279
-I want to return--
-Shove it.

972
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,520
Saikhim told me
how much she wants to kill you.

973
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,520
If she could,
she'd kill you more than just once.

974
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:35,239
Just listening to her

975
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:38,039
makes me want to castrate you.

976
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:40,560
You're both awful and fertile.

977
01:26:41,079 --> 01:26:44,800
May demons curse you with infertility.
The world doesn't need your kind.

978
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:50,880
That's so harsh.

979
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:30,800
Wanna do another test?

980
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:33,720
Just in case.

981
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,199
When you said…

982
01:28:13,279 --> 01:28:14,520
NEXT EPISODE

983
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,239
… "Trust me with your life,"

984
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:23,239
did you mean that,
or was it just something cool to say?

985
01:28:23,319 --> 01:28:24,680
You'd better watch out.

986
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:26,920
My uncle

987
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,479
won't let you get away with it.

988
01:28:29,079 --> 01:28:30,319
But if you stay here,

989
01:28:30,399 --> 01:28:32,000
your dad will find you.

990
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:34,079
-Hey!
-You can't come up here, sir!

991
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:35,079
Don't go there.

992
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,199
-I said, no!
-Get out now!

993
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:38,399
You can't go up there.

994
01:28:39,239 --> 01:28:42,119
This scumbag wants to use this kid
to manipulate Saikhim.

995
01:28:42,199 --> 01:28:45,159
Even if I had nothing but my body,
a dad like you couldn't beat me

996
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:49,079
because you never let her be free,
so she flies back to me, the scumbag.

997
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:51,640
Is it okay?

998
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:27,640
