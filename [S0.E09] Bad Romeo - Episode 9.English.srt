1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,400
THIS FICTIONAL SERIES IS INTENDED
FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY

2
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,759
They said you were dead.

3
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,039
I'm too stubborn to die.

4
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,199
So why are you here?

5
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,879
To watch my enemy die.

6
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,439
What's Prom doing?

7
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,199
Asking someone to investigate Gaogla.

8
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,360
Don't get involved. It could be a trap.

9
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,080
He wants us to get suspicious

10
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:59,240
so he can entrap us for snooping.

11
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,840
So you're the larcenist.

12
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,800
Teach him a lesson
so that he doesn't do it again.

13
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,120
I'll find out
what he wants to use that property for.

14
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,280
I'm good at punching below the belt.

15
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,599
Should I have you try staying the night?

16
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,840
-Well…
-Stay here tonight.

17
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,879
I promise you
that someone will lose more than we did.

18
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,719
I've never wanted to hurt anyone!

19
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,639
But today, I wish you would die!

20
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,400
Hey!

21
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,120
Technology exists to help
make our lives easier.

22
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,840
But it never makes our love lives easier.

23
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,879
We could meet someone easily

24
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,080
or fall in love easily.

25
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,759
But it's harder to build relationships.

26
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,039
You're still here?

27
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,960
I want a bath too.

28
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,199
Clean living? More like dirty-minded.

29
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,400
Wait, Khim.

30
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,840
Khim?

31
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,319
What's wrong?

32
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,599
Sorry, I have to go.

33
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,439
But what about…?

34
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,800
You want an aromatherapy massage?

35
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,000
TANTHAI TULANONT, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER

36
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,399
PRIMPRAO

37
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,199
Look what I've found.

38
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,959
I guess Gaogla and Tanthai are doing
business deals together.

39
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,680
Tan's doing this?

40
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,959
Impossible.

41
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,399
Hey, you.

42
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,319
Hey, you!

43
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,120
What the hell? He's already asleep?

44
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,759
Khim, you're about to get married.
Try acting like a jealous wife.

45
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:46,000
Is he being so nice to you
because he did something to hurt you?

46
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,360
Figure out what he's feeling guilty about.

47
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:52,560
If you can't figure it out,
don't marry him.

48
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,199
A NEW LOAN FOR HOMESTAY PROPRIETORS

49
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,199
A NEW INVESTMENT

50
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,959
Did you know
Tanthai's invested in Gaogla's company?

51
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,720
Tan doesn't really talk to me about work.

52
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:19,160
Doesn't he know
that you and Gaogla are enemies?

53
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,040
I can't let our personal problems
interfere with Tan's work.

54
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,399
When we asked him to invest in our hotels,

55
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,279
he didn't care.

56
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,879
Does this mean Tanthai doesn't respect us?

57
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,920
He must not want us to know

58
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,680
so he kept this quiet.

59
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:46,720
Gosh, I guess he's taking Khim for granted
if he doesn't care how this affects her.

60
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,959
But he's not the only one at fault.

61
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,240
Khim is keeping something from him too.

62
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,879
You can't tell him

63
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,199
that you're Gaogla's ex.

64
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,160
So is there any man
who will be honest with my daughter?

65
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,319
You keep getting duped by them.

66
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,799
Gla!

67
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,559
So you want me to accept the bank's offer?

68
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,559
Okay.

69
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,639
Then we'll see
if we can put fear in their hearts.

70
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,000
We couldn't have got to them
if there were no profit involved.

71
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,279
There's no way.

72
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,759
They want me so badly.
You know what they just did?

73
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,919
They invited me to go yachting with them.

74
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,360
He's supposed to get married soon,

75
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,240
but his dad is throwing him at me.

76
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,600
Women like Saikhim don't deserve
good relationships.

77
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,200
Yeah. You never know.

78
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,039
Maybe she'll never get married.

79
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,240
Hey, Khim. What are you doing here?

80
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,559
I came to visit you, Tan.

81
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,559
Call me in advance next time.
I was just leaving. You nearly missed me.

82
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,159
I just happened to be in the area.

83
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:55,360
Are you on your way to work, Tan?

84
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,639
Today's a holiday.

85
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,399
I have a little work meeting.

86
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,159
Is it very urgent work?

87
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:07,039
Maybe you should hang out at my place.

88
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,399
I'll be right back after work.

89
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,120
It's okay. You should get to work.

90
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,279
Khim.

91
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,639
I'll call you right after work.

92
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,399
Don't worry about me.

93
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,120
Of course work is more important.

94
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,559
You can't compare love with work, Khim.

95
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,559
I'm negotiating with Carl's company.

96
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,320
It's my dad's project, Khim.
We don't know if we'll partner with them.

97
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,519
I didn't tell you

98
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,240
because I noticed
that you have a problem with him.

99
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,919
I didn't want to upset you.

100
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,519
So… why are you telling me now, Tan?

101
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,919
I wanted to tell you myself.

102
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,879
I don't want you to worry

103
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,200
or get upset by something
that someone with bad intentions said.

104
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,799
Thank you, Tan.

105
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,840
Now you're the only one

106
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,240
who's still honest with me.

107
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:55,960
I heard you've seen the Kidakarns.

108
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,000
How did that go?

109
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,600
They must be shocked you're still alive.

110
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,399
I don't know. I didn't care.

111
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,320
What?

112
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,480
Didn't you want to move back here
to get revenge on those people?

113
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,320
It's just a coincidence.
I don't care about those people.

114
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,360
So this relationship must be very serious

115
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,480
if it's made you get over Saikhim.

116
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,879
Ever since that day,
Saikhim lost all meaning to me.

117
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,799
Didn't you get her cousin arrested?

118
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:31,120
Weren't you trying to mess with her?

119
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,919
Don't worry about old flames.

120
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:37,200
Who would dare do something
that you didn't like?

121
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,720
What if I said I didn't like Claire?

122
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,120
Would you dare dump the girl?

123
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,360
That's easy.

124
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,000
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you.

125
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,159
I hope that's true because I'm so tired

126
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,399
of people who don't mean what they say.

127
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,720
Claire is very sweet.

128
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,960
I'll introduce her to you.

129
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,039
You're infatuated with her.

130
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,240
You're so obvious.

131
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,039
I'm head over heels.

132
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,480
Love stinks, doesn't it?

133
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,480
Any updates on the old house
that I asked you to check out?

134
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,440
I spoke to the owner.

135
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:08,559
And? Could it be our first boutique hotel?

136
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,559
It's quite pretty.

137
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,600
But I think it could be more than that.

138
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,480
What could be better than making it
a hotel to mock our competitors?

139
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
A new hotel

140
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:23,279
opposite the Kidakarns' hotel.

141
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,159
Not only will we get rich,

142
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,559
we'll also get to insult those people.

143
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:30,960
I haven't thought that far
because the owner doesn't want to sell it.

144
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,399
I asked you to work for me,
not run a charity!

145
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,720
You still can't prioritize business?

146
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,519
I'm starting to wonder
if you care about Saikhim's feelings.

147
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,279
Not at all.
I don't care about those people.

148
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,919
And I won't condescend
to compete with them.

149
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,799
Then maybe you're focusing
on your application too much,

150
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,120
so you're not dedicated
to following my orders.

151
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,679
Do you still care about me?

152
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,919
I guess there's a lot
I still have to teach you

153
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,039
just like your first day in this job.

154
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,679
I even had to teach you to put on a tie.

155
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,720
Aren't you afraid of losing…

156
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,240
what your dad left behind for you?

157
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,320
Don't you want to take over from him?

158
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,639
You're lucky to be his son.

159
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,000
You should live up to this life,
not throw it away.

160
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,320
Khem.

161
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:14,240
Hey.

162
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,840
What are you wearing?

163
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:17,919
A collar.

164
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,519
Someone tried to put a leash on me.
Anyway, what are you doing?

165
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,080
Madame asked me
to throw out your dad's stuff.

166
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:36,759
Hey, bro.

167
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,120
The interesting part is

168
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,159
there are documents she wanted to destroy.

169
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,159
I tried to put them back together,
but I couldn't read them,

170
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,000
so I searched your dad's computer.

171
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,360
Bingo. I found these files.

172
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,399
Take this stuff.

173
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,960
I used a translation app

174
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,640
and found that it's your dad's will.

175
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,480
I thought there wasn't one.

176
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,480
Well, there is.

177
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,920
Your mom's name's in it too.

178
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,799
MR. ALEKSAY, MRS. ASIA, MR. NATHAN,
MS. RAKROY BOONRUEANG

179
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,240
Your dad wanted
to give you a portion of his estate.

180
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,559
But Madame chose not to use this will
because she didn't want you to take it.

181
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,839
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

182
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,440
She adopted you herself

183
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,440
to disinherit you
from her husband's estate.

184
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:46,559
She wants to keep your inheritance
all to herself and her son.

185
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,599
So that's the price of her kindness.

186
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,960
I'll never let any woman control my life.

187
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,559
We got all of it.

188
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,720
I told her I'd get rid of it.

189
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,279
If that will is real,
she's more dangerous than I thought.

190
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,440
Tan has admitted

191
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:31,200
he's doing business with Gaogla.

192
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,119
He said that, and you believe him?

193
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:41,400
That woman you saw is Gaogla's sister.
Tan isn't interested in her.

194
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:46,000
But I'm more worried about Tan
getting conned by those people.

195
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,480
If he's not interested in her,
maybe he's interested in her money.

196
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,000
Money is the great leveler.

197
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,720
You sound like you don't know Tan.

198
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,799
So you'll just let this go?

199
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:58,119
Listen.

200
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,960
Stop being an angel all the time
as if you're scared he won't love you.

201
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,799
When you're a woman,

202
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,960
the meaner you are,
the more they love you.

203
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:08,640
Got it?

204
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:20,440
But if you're mean,
and you only attract that sort of guy,

205
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:21,680
that's not so good.

206
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,599
Will he ever leave you alone?

207
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,200
If we build new condos,

208
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,960
I'll reserve a penthouse
for you to decorate.

209
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,440
Where are these condos?

210
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:37,359
What?

211
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,240
Hasn't Saikhim told you?

212
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,240
We're building condos opposite our hotel.

213
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,759
I want you to decorate…

214
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,839
our marital home.

215
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,599
I hope they find a cure
for your wishful thinking.

216
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,519
To make a full recovery,

217
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,319
I need someone to make me better.

218
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,000
Serious question.

219
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:10,200
How did you get so conceited?

220
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,799
You'll see.

221
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:20,599
Eventually, you'll end up with me.

222
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:22,440
We're a good match

223
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:24,519
'cause we know each other's flaws.

224
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:42,799
I can't believe
you can stand people like him.

225
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,839
Really? Do I look like I can stand him?

226
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,440
If he were the last person on Earth,
I still wouldn't want him.

227
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:52,200
Thank goodness. Don't let your guard down.

228
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,200
Prom is in there.

229
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,200
Let's go somewhere else.

230
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:03,960
He'll definitely yell at you.

231
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,680
Let's go.

232
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,680
You fooled Khim today,

233
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,759
but you can't fool her forever.

234
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:16,480
You should worry about yourself first.

235
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:20,599
Wait. Hey!

236
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,599
Damn. What a stupid double agent.

237
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,119
He doesn't know
he's getting Gaogla's sloppy seconds,

238
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,960
and he's his errand boy too.

239
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:29,880
Look, honey.

240
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,799
Dad?

241
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,720
I got your vegetables.

242
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,440
If I eat any more of them,
I'll be able to photosynthesize.

243
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,240
Why did you send so much?

244
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
I want to feed you the good stuff.

245
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,960
It's for the seventh anniversary

246
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,960
of your death and rebirth.

247
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,200
You were given a new life.

248
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:09,000
Take very good care of it.

249
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:14,880
Gla!

250
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,519
Don't die!

251
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:20,680
Gla!

252
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,200
Stay strong!

253
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,480
Don't die, Gla!

254
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,920
I used a translation app

255
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,160
and found that it's your dad's will.

256
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,599
She wants to keep your inheritance
all to herself and her son.

257
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,960
I want you to be careful.

258
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:43,880
You were lucky to wake up.

259
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,319
Jeez, I know.

260
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,039
You have to be very grateful
to your adoptive mother.

261
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,160
She helped give you a new life.

262
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,079
Without her,

263
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,640
you wouldn't be there now.

264
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,039
Is she still kind to you?

265
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:00,240
Don't worry, Dad.

266
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,839
I'll never forget what she did.

267
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:09,480
I'll pay her back double
everything she's done.

268
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,160
Hi, bro.

269
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,319
I checked your Mac.

270
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,759
This morning, Madame called
to pressure me about the boutique hotel.

271
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:48,599
She said she'd find an architect
to renovate that house.

272
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,000
Boutique hotel?

273
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:53,200
She sent us a project plan that she likes.

274
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,119
It's saved on the laptop.
I'll bring it to you.

275
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:41,599

278
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,480
Hello.

279
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,680
Hello.

280
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,400
I'm looking for a housekeeper.

281
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,839
Could you take care of my place
while I'm away?

282
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,960
Yes, I can.

283
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,079
Three or four hours should be enough.

284
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,680
I'll be back tonight.

285
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,880
Please tidy up the place
and put my clothes away.

286
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,000
I'll send you all the details.

287
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,200
All right.

288
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:36,000
CARL RAMAN, CANAPAYA RESIDENCES

289
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,960
Since they're aristocrats,
are you gonna kneel to them?

290
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,200
I don't want them to think
we just want to buy their house.

291
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,079
I want this to feel like a family visit.

292
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,759
I don't want to push them too soon.

293
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:53,799
Hey, bro.

294
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,599
Maybe they need money
and want to sell the house.

295
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:04,119
Say that, and they'll be insulted
that we're throwing money at them.

296
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,559
We won't be greedy capitalists
like the Kidakarns.

297
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,359
We will never look so desperate for money.

298
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,079
That's so rude.

299
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,640
I spoke to your sister about the project.

300
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,759
Gloyjai is new to investing.

301
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,519
Please feel free to give her tips.

302
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,400
No problem.

303
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:35,759
I'm sure you two will get along.

304
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,279
Yes.

305
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,799
We brought Indian gooseberries.
They're indigenous and medicinal.

306
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,960
-They're for you.
-Gosh!

307
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:58,920
Yes, ma'am.

308
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,079
Thank you, my dear, for bringing me these.

309
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,400
My dad has a plantation in the North.
He raised me on medicinal food.

310
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,759
Really, dear? Look at that huge basket.

311
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:12,000
We can't possibly eat all that.

312
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:14,279
The hotel opposite us over there

313
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,440
just brought it to us.

314
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:18,519
They had their people speak to me.

315
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:22,839
They want to buy my property
and build new condos here.

316
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,960
-I'll take this.
-All right.

317
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:26,880
Come on.

318
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,319
Let's go, kids.

319
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:32,039
New condos?

320
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:34,960
That's right, dear.
But let me tell you something.

321
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,599
I don't think I'll sell it to them

322
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,160
because I think

323
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,519
I will end up dying right here, my dear.

324
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:44,240
Why would you say that?

325
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:49,160
Anyway, you boys are here now.

326
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,079
-All right. Chor?
-Yes?

327
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,119
Why don't we

328
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,400
make Indian gooseberry chili paste?

329
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,680
Then they can taste it.
Does that sound good?

330
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:58,079
-Yes, ma'am.
-All right?

331
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,039
Yes, ma'am.

332
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:01,440
Have you ever tried that, boys?

333
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:03,039
I can't wait to have some.

334
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:04,839
Well, wait just a moment.

335
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,839
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

336
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,000
-Let's go and make some now.
-Yes, ma'am.

337
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:25,759
It's not his first name.

338
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,759
His birthday?

339
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,079
His ID card number?

340
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:49,079
One more attempt left.

341
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,200
Are you avoiding me?
I know you're in there.

342
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:23,920
He's not here.

343
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,680
He left it open to tempt me.

344
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:41,400
Password?

345
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,880
Jeez. Don't send him a notification!

346
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,440
Damn! I'm screwed!

347
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,319
HI, SOMEONE TRIED TO LOG IN…

348
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,279
Someone tried to use my Mac.

349
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,920
It was in that room this morning.

350
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,519
Who went in there?

351
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,000
Hello.

352
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:24,000
Miss, are you at my condo?

353
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:29,839
Well… I got here
and happened to run into your girlfriend.

354
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,000
My girlfriend?

355
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,200
That's right.

356
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:33,880
A petite woman

357
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,240
who looks rich and pretty,
and… she's wearing revealing clothes.

358
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:42,880
She's not my girlfriend.
Don't worry. I'll deal with this.

359
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,279
Damn!

360
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:55,559
Hello. What do you want?

361
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,079
What are you doing at my place?

362
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,359
Well, didn't you say

363
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,079
that we could keep it casual?

364
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,319
Are you backing down?

365
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,039
When did I ever say that to you?

366
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:09,799
Are you doing something to my Mac?

367
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,920
No, I must have touched it by mistake
when I put my stuff down.

368
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,920
Stop playing dirty to get intel on me.

369
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:19,839
Don't you Kidakarns know
how to fight honorably?

370
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,880
-Look…
-Remember this.

371
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,599
Your condos will never happen.

372
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,480
Get out of my place right now.
And return my key card.

373
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,680
If you keep interfering,

374
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:31,240
I'll ban your friend's place
from the system

375
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,680
for security issues.

376
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,160
Wait. What?

377
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:37,160
Damn it!

378
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,720
Okay, I give up.

379
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,519
They haven't learned.

380
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,839
How dare they try to steal your laptop?

381
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,359
So we're fighting cornered dogs.

382
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,039
This game is unexpectedly brutal.

383
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,839
Fortunately,

384
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,319
we have the upper hand.

385
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,319
Here it is!

386
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,000
-Bring it out.
-Come on.

387
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,480
Bring it out quickly.

388
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:14,880
Good.

389
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,920
-Put it down.
-May I sit here?

390
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,759
-Please sit, my dears.
-Thank you.

391
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:22,480
Go ahead and sit. Look at this.

392
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,839
You see this?

393
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,920
Our Indian gooseberry chili paste.

394
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,119
-You see that?
-It looks delicious.

395
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,960
Eat as much as you can, my dears.

396
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,839
When you finish eating this,
could you please tell me

397
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,799
if you like this recipe?

398
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,200
If you think it's good,
I'll add it to the recipe book.

399
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,119
Here, ma'am.

400
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,599
What is that?

401
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,680
Well, it's my recipe book.

402
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:52,119
My family's recipes are in this section.

403
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,279
May I see that, Auntie?

404
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:55,839
Yes, of course, my dear.

405
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,759
There you go, dear.
Take a look at my recipes.

406
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:01,880
GREEN CURRY PASTE, 100 GRAMS

407
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,960
If you want to publish a recipe book,
I can help you, Auntie.

408
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:08,760
-Really, dear?
-We'll type the recipes one by one.

409
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,280
Then we'll proofread them
to make sure nothing's missing.

410
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,800
My goodness! Thank you so much, dear.

411
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,639
But would you boys really have time
to do all that for me?

412
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,000
If I get to enjoy all this delicious food,
I'm perfectly happy to help.

413
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,559
Okay, let's do that. Now eat.

414
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:28,199
-You need your strength to help me write.
-That's a deal?

415
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,519
-Yes, ma'am.
-Great.

416
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,320
You watch your boyfriend at all hours.
Are you scared he'll get away?

417
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,400
No, I'm scared he'll want something
more casual like you do.

418
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,400
I guess your whole family knows now.

419
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:17,519
Clean eating can't save you

420
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,800
if you still behave like this.

421
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,559
People with clean records don't burgle
other people's homes.

422
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:26,840
You have double standards.

423
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,719
You're sacrificing yourself
for industrial espionage.

424
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,280
What a good person.

425
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,440
If you're coming and going so freely,
what if you enter the wrong apartment?

426
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,639
When I spit something out,

427
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,480
I don't try to eat it again.

428
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,119
Gla!

429
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,119
Who are you talking to?

430
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,519
Who do you think?

431
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:48,000
My name is Carl.

432
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,679
What does he want now?

433
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,800
What…

434
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,360
what is it, sir?

435
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,840
I called to thank you.

436
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,639
I need another favor, miss.

437
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:40,199
I'll be working in Shanghai all week.

438
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,199
Do you usually cook for yourself?

439
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:45,320
What do you need, sir?

440
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,199
I left lots of organic vegetables
in the fridge and some boxes.

441
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,360
If you'd like to use them,
please go ahead.

442
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,920
They're from my dad's plantation.
I don't want to let them go to waste.

443
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,679
I'm offering them to you,

444
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,039
and in exchange, while I'm away,
you can look after my mushrooms.

445
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,239
Yes, of course.

446
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,800
Thank you.

447
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,880
Since you started helping me out,

448
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,400
I've felt so much better.

449
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,920
Let's see how much better you'll feel.

450
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,400
ALREADY CHARGED

451
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,199
If only I could bring you
as a spare battery.

452
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,280
When I'm tired,
I think of you, and I feel stronger.

453
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,280
I don't know where that energy comes from.
I want you near me so you can recharge me.

454
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,719
In that case,

455
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,519
I'll fully recharge you right now.

456
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,880
What?

457
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,280
I just got home.
I need more time to recharge.

458
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,880
I'm still tired. What should we do?

459
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,719
Can I charge my spare battery?

460
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:42,480
#DOMEAFAVOR

461
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,679
#BONAPPÉTIT

462
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:15,800
I don't think Mr. Carl is alone.

463
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,280
He's with a woman.

464
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,519
But that's Saikhim!

465
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:21,960
What's she doing there?

466
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:38,239
Go and watch them.
I must know what they are to each other.

467
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,159
Yes, ma'am.

468
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,880
Today, we're talking about adopting
Carl's room booking system.

469
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:01,960
So our clients can go there
to view the product details,

470
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:04,519
the room prices, and the available dates.

471
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,880
APPLICATION ARSA: NO NOTIFICATIONS

472
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,599
I'm voting for you early and often.
This year, you're going to win for sure.

473
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,400
The Woman of the Year prize.

474
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,559
If you don't win, I don't know who will.

475
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,719
Whatever. Let's see who I'm up against.

476
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,800
Look.

477
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,719
See? We're competing against each other.
I can't compete with Khim.

478
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,960
Gosh! Well, forget it, then.

479
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:44,079
Okay, we don't need the prize.

480
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:48,400
When it comes to boyfriends, at least,

481
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,599
you'll outdo Miss Khim for sure

482
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:56,280
because her dad is so overprotective
that it'll be hard for her to get married.

483
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,760
Listen, Mom.

484
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,400
Khim is about to get married.

485
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,159
What? She's getting married?

486
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:03,519
Yeah.

487
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:05,239
To her second husband?

488
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:09,000
And yet you still haven't had
a serious boyfriend?

489
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,480
Well, don't give up yet.

490
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:18,199
Destiny is a great leveler.

491
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,760
Your soul mate

492
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,920
is right outside the door now!

493
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,679
-Hey!
-Turn and look.

494
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,079
Don't tell me
you set me up with someone again.

495
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:30,159
I keep telling you not to do that!

496
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:32,280
I didn't ask this one to come.

497
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,880
A client heard you qualified

498
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,320
for Woman of the Year
and thinks this guy's your perfect match,

499
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,159
so I offered him my services.

500
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,679
What on earth, Mom?

501
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,079
Deal with him yourself.

502
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:46,199
I'm sick and tired of your taste. Bye!

503
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,519
-You…
-Bye!

504
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:49,159
Good grief!

505
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:56,079
Well, what a sight for sore eyes!

506
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,119
Is this Lita's place?

507
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,880
I'm sick of this! Why must she meddle?

508
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,559
If he's basic,

509
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:09,800
I'm better off alone!

510
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:11,519
Gosh!

511
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,159
Whatever, Mom.

512
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:15,960
Lita!

513
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:17,960
You have a visitor!

514
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,719
Come down here right now!

515
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:30,000
I should leave.

516
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,440
I was stupid to come.

517
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:36,679
TANTHAI, 12 CALLS

518
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,840
Why so many calls?

519
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,679
Gosh!

520
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:49,440
I'm sorry I didn't call you in advance.
Am I interrupting anything, Auntie?

521
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:52,719
Gosh, it's no problem.
Listen, you can call me Mama.

522
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,880
You don't have to be so polite.
And you are…?

523
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,360
I'm Tanthai.

524
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,199
Well, goodness me!
Even your name is gorgeous too.

525
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,760
What do you do?

526
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,760
I work in a bank.

527
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:04,360
By the way,

528
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,760
here you go.

529
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,519
Well, goodness me!
No wonder you look so distinguished.

530
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:15,840
This way, please.

531
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,079
-Since you're here, let's not waste time.
-Sure.

532
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:21,679
Come here. This way, please.

533
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,760
-Lie down, please.
-Hey.

534
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,159
Just lie down.

535
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,159
We're going to make you
even more handsome.

536
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:30,960
When Lita comes down here,

537
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:33,199
you're going to make her squeal!

538
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,400
Glasses off.

539
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:39,920
If you work at a bank,
your transfers must be so fast.

540
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:41,639
Pardon?

541
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:44,000
You must be a sugar daddy.

542
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:48,320
Hey, would you lend me 1,000 baht?

543
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,360
What?

544
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,280
Look, I've been meaning to ask

545
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,199
if you'd help me vote for Lita
in the Woman of the Year contest.

546
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,880
Lita is afraid she'll lose
to her best friend who also qualified,

547
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,239
so I'm encouraging everyone
in the province to vote for her.

548
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,960
-Excuse me, Mama.
-Sure.

549
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,320
Where are you?

550
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:19,880
Hello?

551
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,320
Hello?

552
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,400
-Hello?
-Hello?

553
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:26,519
-Hello?
-Hello?

554
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:28,960
Where are you going? Where?

555
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:30,320
-Mom!
-What?

556
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,039
Bro!

557
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:38,079
Jeez, you should've told me
you were coming.

558
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:42,199
If Mom had wheedled you any longer,
you would've got yourself a mother-in-law.

559
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,679
You didn't answer my calls.

560
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:46,360
So what's so urgent?

561
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:49,079
Dad and Khim.

562
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:50,519
What did you say?

563
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,360
It's about Dad and Khim.

564
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,519
I can't hear you. Say it again.

565
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,639
It's about Dad and Khim!

566
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,599
You mean your dad wants
a richer daughter-in-law than Saikhim?

567
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,320
How dare he?

568
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,159
Don't tell Khim, okay?

569
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,760
If he doesn't ask for permission
for you to marry her,

570
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,599
Khim will figure it out anyway.

571
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:20,119
Dad doesn't mind. He just isn't sure.

572
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:22,119
If Khim thinks negatively about my family,

573
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:23,639
she may not want to marry me.

574
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:32,760
Will you buy my silence?

575
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,880
I'll vote for you.

576
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,840
I'll spend 10,000.

577
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,280
Don't you want it?

578
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,559
Woman of the Year?

579
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:45,360
Can you be my bodyguard?

580
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,320
Make my mom stop setting me up with men.

581
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,920
If you can get rid of the guy
who's coming today,

582
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,360
I promise you

583
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,960
that I'll take this thing with your dad
with me to the grave!

584
00:46:58,039 --> 00:46:59,239
Hello!

585
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:12,719
I have an appointment.

586
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:19,960
-My goodness!
-Hello, ma'am.

587
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:22,840
You can't see.

588
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:30,800
Can you see now?

589
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,960
That's the guy.

590
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:35,400
Ma'am.

591
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,360
-That guy?
-That's right.

592
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,679
I heard that you just moved here.

593
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,199
Yes, I'm the new principal
at one of the schools.

594
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,280
Gosh! Really?

595
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,840
Then you must love kids!

596
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,800
Honey, let's take pictures together.

597
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:06,440
-Look straight ahead.
-One, two, three.

598
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:10,800
-Smile a little. One. Two.
-Oh dear.

599
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,679
-Three.
-Gosh! Please turn this way.

600
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,159
Get closer. Put your face closer.

601
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:17,320
Goodness! Please look straight ahead.

602
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,559
Is this short enough?

603
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:19,840
That's enough!

604
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,800
Tell me, Mr. Principal,
have you been to the farmers' market?

605
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,840
-Do you live alone? Who cooks for you?
-Well, I…--

606
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,440
Gosh, now you mention it, I'm so hungry!

607
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:37,199
-What should we order for dinner tonight?
-My goodness.

608
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,679
If you get hungry,
you can eat here with us anytime.

609
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,519
I have such a headache!

610
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,119
It's so hot today.

611
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:45,360
Honey, can you give me a massage?

612
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,360
-Hey.
-Massage me.

613
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,960
Massage me really hard.

614
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,400
That's so good! Keep doing that!

615
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,159
We're finished, Mr. Principal.

616
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:06,280
All done.

617
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,559
I should go now.

618
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,719
Well… thank you, sir.

619
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,760
Damn it! Just go upstairs to her room!

620
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,840
Hey, mister.

621
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,480
Your bank transfers are fast,
and you move fast when it comes to women!

622
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:51,199
Move fast in what way, Mom?

623
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,960
Wait, Mr. Principal!
You forgot your change!

624
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,360
You made a promise.

625
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,400
Keep it, okay?

626
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:32,480
Miss?

627
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,599
I wouldn't be surprised
if you fell for such a perfect guy.

628
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:15,440
Mom!

629
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:17,719
What do you mean?

630
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,280
The way you look at him like that.
Do you think I can't tell?

631
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,119
Rich guys like him

632
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,599
Well… it was just an act
to teach you a lesson.

633
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:34,760
Do you think
I'd actually get serious with him?

634
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,679
Whatever.

635
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,559
You keep wanting
something you've never had,

636
00:51:55,639 --> 00:51:59,119
so you'll never be happy
with what you do have.

637
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,920
And if you still feel jealous,
that's a sign that, deep down,

638
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,519
you're still less than Saikhim.

639
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,239
Women who are smart and impressive

640
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,719
should be more confident!

641
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,280
And you, my baby,
are too good to steal from someone else.

642
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,440
If they don't love us,
we have to love ourselves.

643
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,039
Mom, I love Khim.

644
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,719
But sometimes, I can't help comparing us.

645
00:53:07,239 --> 00:53:09,119
Everything comes to her so easily.

646
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:11,400
And it makes me so angry

647
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,239
that Khim keeps making me feel

648
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,079
like I'm a villain.

649
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:17,639
No one's life is so easy.

650
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,360
Even Khim has her own problems.

651
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:25,000
The universe sends good men to love her

652
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:28,320
to make up for her dad's wrongheaded love.

653
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:33,679
Saikhim had no one else to love her,
so she had to be a good girl all her life

654
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,960
to make her dad proud.

655
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,599
As for you,

656
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:41,679
no matter how chaotic you are,
I never criticize you.

657
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,440
When someone loves you freely,

658
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:46,360
and you don't have to ask them to,
you're very lucky.

659
00:53:47,639 --> 00:53:50,440
This is why
Khim is less fortunate than you are.

660
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:02,159
Since you are more loved than your friend,
share some love with her.

661
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,719
And if you don't want to be
the Villainess of the Year,

662
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,320
stop being jealous of Saikhim.

663
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,880
Let your friend
have a good relationship for once.

664
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,000
Actually, you know what?

665
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,239
Soft-spoken men like him,

666
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,800
if you really spend time with them,
they turn out to be so boring.

667
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,480
He seems too serious.

668
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:26,519
You, my baby,

669
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:29,400
should have someone really exciting.

670
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,719
We are a family of fierce women, baby.

671
00:54:46,039 --> 00:54:47,159
Mr. Seen?

672
00:54:47,239 --> 00:54:50,239
-What?
-I've found a flaw in Gaogla's Arsa app.

673
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:53,920
People are using it
as a front for illegal activities.

674
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,639
-How?
-Tourists are seeking local guides.

675
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,480
It makes it hard for us to regulate them.

676
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:03,559
And people are using personal vehicles
to provide public services.

677
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,480
It's just like the other app
that got banned.

678
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:10,559
Ban this one too.

679
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:12,559
Put them out of business.

680
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:16,920
I've published exposés of these issues.
The backlash should follow soon.

681
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,119
Good. Hit them hard.

682
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:20,679
Make them move back home.

683
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:57,880
Gla! Look at this.

684
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,239
The media is boycotting our app.

685
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,599
They say it lets young people
do problematic jobs.

686
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:09,039
Find out who released these stories.
Check and see who's behind them.

687
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,000
I asked you to come back early
because of this backlash.

688
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:15,639
By the way,
a TV show wants to interview you by phone.

689
00:56:15,719 --> 00:56:16,840
Do you have a statement?

690
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,360
I'll do the interview myself.
Things might calm down.

691
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,400
-Yeah, okay.
-Hey, bro, wait.

692
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,119
You have to go and see Madame first.

693
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:24,320
She says it's urgent.

694
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:33,280
I told you, didn't I?

695
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:37,119
There's a flaw in your app,

696
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:39,400
so they're attacking you now.

697
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,480
No, they don't dare to fight face to face,
so they ambush us instead.

698
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:47,000
Would you still say
the Kidakarns aren't our competitors?

699
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:50,880
You said you wouldn't let personal grudges
interfere with your work life,

700
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,199
but that's impossible now.

701
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:54,440
You were too careless.

702
00:56:54,519 --> 00:56:55,599
I admit it.

703
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:59,320
I underestimated those people,
so they've ganged up on me.

704
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:03,039
Wait.

705
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,599
Someone else has tried to mess with us.

706
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,119
The other day,

707
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:16,480
I sent a messenger to your place
while you were away.

708
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:19,920
I found out that the housekeeper you hired

709
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,119
is quite something.

710
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,880
Deal with this father and daughter pair.

711
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,119
If you can't handle it,

712
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:37,960
I'll deal with them myself.

713
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,360
I'll do phone interviews
with anyone who asks today.

714
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,679
A hotel guest contacted
a massage therapist in the area.

715
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:06,039
Good.

716
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:07,519
Send her up.

717
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:12,719
-Ann.
-Yes, sir.

718
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,119
-I've hit the Accept button.
-Go on up.

719
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:22,039
Yes, sir.

720
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:29,039
Let's see if he can resist
this massage therapist.

721
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,559
If we can prove
the app is used for sex trafficking,

722
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:33,440
it will get shut down.

723
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,559
I can confirm

724
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:41,639
that our app verifies users' identities
via a registration process.

725
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:44,559
All of our users can be verified.

726
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:47,639
Our app is
built on helping others and being kind.

727
00:58:47,719 --> 00:58:50,679
We don't allow
illegal hiring practices or child labor.

728
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,719
She's still in there, Uncle.

729
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,519
I guess it's not just a massage.

730
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:02,079
We can use this video to expose them

731
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:04,239
for using the app
as a front for sex workers.

732
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,199
That volunteerism stuff

733
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,000
is just advertising.

734
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:10,320
Uncle, go on that news show tomorrow,

735
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,039
and we'll use this video to expose them.

736
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,039
But in the end,

737
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,039
this woman is just someone we planted.

738
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:20,599
Plant or not,
we get to play with our prey.

739
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:22,800
We have shown
that the app has a security flaw.

740
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:26,320
That Gaogla

741
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:27,840
acting all holy

742
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,159
when he's actually a phony pimp.

743
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,840
Who's fooling whom?

744
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:36,400
If the truth comes out,
Uncle Seen will have to clean up the mess.

745
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,960
Damn! Whose side are you on?

746
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:40,719
I can confirm

747
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:44,119
that our app verifies users' identities
via a registration process.

748
00:59:44,199 --> 00:59:45,480
He has leveled up.

749
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,760
He's not as basic as when he tricked Khim.

750
00:59:51,159 --> 00:59:55,000
Prom, your stupid plan can't hurt
a crafty guy like him.

751
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:01,639
Even you can trick him into bed,

752
01:00:01,719 --> 01:00:03,280
so he can't be that smart!

753
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,480
Keep this evidence secure.

754
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:10,519
I'll humiliate him in front of the media

755
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,159
so he won't be able to work in Thailand.

756
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:33,599
Coming to see Tan?

757
01:00:38,519 --> 01:00:39,760
What about you?

758
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,559
Don't tell me you came to see Gaogla.

759
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,480
What if I did? Are you jealous?

760
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,079
Be careful. Don't let him brainwash you.

761
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,760
Why are you here?

762
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,280
Don't even bother
if you've come to make it up to me.

763
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,239
Hey, Khim.

764
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,559
What are you doing here?

765
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,400
Wanna come in?

766
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:33,880
Yes.

767
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:39,199
I came to warn you.

768
01:01:39,719 --> 01:01:42,639
Tomorrow, Prom will leak news
to damage your company again.

769
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:48,159
-Why are you telling me?
-To show that I'm on your side.

770
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:52,039
You can betray even your own family,

771
01:01:52,119 --> 01:01:53,960
and you think I'd trust you?

772
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:57,800
Let the scandal happen
and trust me later if you want.

773
01:02:05,079 --> 01:02:07,239
But believe me, this time, the evidence

774
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,039
will leave you powerless.

775
01:02:09,719 --> 01:02:13,679
If you're worried,
you could talk to Prom about hush money,

776
01:02:15,519 --> 01:02:18,599
or if you agree to let go of
the property opposite our hotel,

777
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:22,039
maybe Uncle Seen will decide
not to expose you after all.

778
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,559
-Yeah, Khem?
-Bro, I've checked.

779
01:02:33,639 --> 01:02:36,119
Today, a tourist used our app
at the Elite Hotel.

780
01:02:36,199 --> 01:02:38,800
I tried to verify
the user's volunteerism history.

781
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,159
It's like a brand-new user.

782
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:44,159
Maybe it's a fake account
made to accept jobs fraudulently.

783
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:46,239
I have a bad feeling about this, bro.

784
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:53,840
A fake job hunter? So we've been deceived.

785
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:00,199
I told you so.

786
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,719
I have to take care of this.

787
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:05,400
Tell your family that this time,
I'm fighting them kamikaze style.

788
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:23,880
Khim.

789
01:03:24,519 --> 01:03:25,880
I researched wedding dates.

790
01:03:26,519 --> 01:03:28,239
A monk found us auspicious dates

791
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,639
in six months and at the end of the year.

792
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,199
I left something in my car.

793
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,119
I'll just go grab it.

794
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:38,039
Sure, honey.

795
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,519
Where are those CCTV images?

796
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,480
Here they are, sir.

797
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:49,760
I WATERED THESE

798
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:05,800
Nice weather, right?

799
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:07,760
Yes.

800
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:21,559
Have you picked the wedding date?

801
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:29,199
If you haven't picked one yet,
why don't we order some dinner first?

802
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,159
All right.

803
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,280
I'll be right back.

804
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:41,159
Are you having a great time?

805
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,719
-What's wrong?
-Nice poker face.

806
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,280
What the hell is up with you?

807
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,559
You must be angry
your true colors have been exposed.

808
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:04,199
I don't care about that

809
01:06:05,079 --> 01:06:07,039
because I realize that I'm basic.

810
01:06:07,639 --> 01:06:08,719
I'm not good at faking.

811
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,320
I can't deceive like you do.

812
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:13,000
I'll never sink as low as you.

813
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:16,159
You're the one who messed up.
Why are you taking it out on me?

814
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:18,760
Yeah, I messed up
because I underestimated you.

815
01:06:19,719 --> 01:06:22,559
You're so awful.
You have so many tricks up your sleeve.

816
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:23,920
If I'm awful,

817
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:26,119
then you must be evil!

818
01:06:26,199 --> 01:06:27,880
Khim! What's wrong?

819
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,320
Show your true colors.

820
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,119
Stop faking and playing dumb.

821
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,239
What do you mean?

822
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:39,519
Have you seen her true self?

823
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,000
She's actually a real piece of work.

824
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:44,760
She says awful things
and thinks awful things.

825
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,079
You're such a good person.

826
01:06:47,159 --> 01:06:50,559
So there it is.
Eventually, the dark side had to come out.

827
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:52,079
You're a coward face to face.

828
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:53,639
Behind my back, you're so brave.

829
01:06:54,679 --> 01:06:55,519
Mr. Carl!

830
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,400
You know what?

831
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:05,159
She's good at killing people
who feel sorry for her.

832
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,519
What do you mean?

833
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:08,440
Wait and see.

834
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:11,840
I'll drag your lies and deceit
out into the light.

835
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,599
And you'll see that this woman

836
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:15,320
is so evil on the inside.

837
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:19,360
Why are you so quiet? Why don't you speak?

838
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,079
If you're silently cursing me,
I feel nothing.

839
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:23,679
One day,

840
01:07:24,519 --> 01:07:26,480
you'll know the taste
of a lover's betrayal.

841
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:39,360
What happened, Khim?
Why are you two fighting all of a sudden?

842
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:41,880
He started it.

843
01:07:43,639 --> 01:07:45,840
And why were you two so rude?

844
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:47,800
What happened between you?

845
01:07:52,599 --> 01:07:53,559
It's just business.

846
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,760
My dad exposed his business.

847
01:07:59,559 --> 01:08:01,079
No wonder he's so angry.

848
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:20,760
Today, a tourist used our app
at the Elite Hotel.

849
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,640
I tried to verify
the user's volunteerism history.

850
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,279
It's like a brand-new user.

851
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:27,159
Maybe it's a fake account

852
01:08:27,239 --> 01:08:28,800
made to accept jobs fraudulently.

853
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,560
KASALONG SANGCHAI

854
01:08:48,199 --> 01:08:50,600
She's good at killing people
who feel sorry for her.

855
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:52,880
What do you mean?

856
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:53,800
Wait and see.

857
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:57,199
I'll drag your lies and deceit
out into the light.

858
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:58,960
And you'll see that this woman

859
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:00,680
is so evil on the inside.

860
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:01,880
Why are you so quiet?

861
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,159
Why don't you speak?

862
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:05,640
If you're silently cursing me,
I feel nothing.

863
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:06,960
One day,

864
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:09,159
you'll know the taste
of a lover's betrayal.

865
01:09:25,239 --> 01:09:27,880
Are you still awake? I need a favor, miss.

866
01:09:37,079 --> 01:09:40,560
I'm moving out of this condo,
but I don't have enough time,

867
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,920
so I want to ask one last favor of you.

868
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,319
I'd like you to supervise the movers.

869
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,680
If it's not too much trouble,
please do this one last favor.

870
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:04,680
No problem. I'll help you out, sir.

871
01:10:09,399 --> 01:10:10,560
Thank you.

872
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,279
Today, Songseen is doing a TV interview

873
01:10:43,359 --> 01:10:45,039
about our app's illegal activities.

874
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:49,119
Find out which channel and which show,
and tell them I'm coming too.

875
01:10:51,239 --> 01:10:52,600
Now we'll have some fun.

876
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:10,479
Miss Khim, Gaogla has offered to appear
on TV with Mr. Seen tonight.

877
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:17,560
APP CREATOR CARL RAMAN
TO FACE TOURISM MINISTER

878
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,840
I think this dispute is going to be
more complicated than we thought.

879
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,720
Dad isn't wise to his tricks.

880
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:33,319
APP CREATOR CARL RAMAN
TO FACE TOURISM MINISTER

881
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,000
I'm lucky you let me
appear on the same show.

882
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:05,640
This is good.
I think this will benefit the public.

883
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,359
I look forward to hearing

884
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:10,680
what you say in response

885
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:14,119
and how you'll fix this issue.

886
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,319
If my system is the problem, I can fix it.

887
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:28,960
But if the problem is people's attitudes,
we all need to work on that.

888
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:32,159
Today, I hope
that we can win some people's hearts

889
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:33,640
and help broaden their minds.

890
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:39,760
Smug, aren't you?

891
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,600
Don't embarrass yourself live on air.

892
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,760
We'll see who loses face
and goes home empty-handed.

893
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:09,000
Ready? Five.

894
01:13:09,079 --> 01:13:11,079
Four. Three. Two.

895
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:16,760
Hello and welcome to today's episode
of Untangling the News.

896
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:22,439
We'll be talking about a very hot topic
that's trending at the moment.

897
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:26,439
It's a famous application
that has raised the question,

898
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:29,520
"Should this app be used in Thailand?"

899
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,399
Let's talk about ethics.

900
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:45,479
This way, please.

901
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:49,520
Today, we welcome to our show

902
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:50,960
Mr. Songseen Kidakarn,

903
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:53,960
the Minister of Tourism and Sports.

904
01:13:54,039 --> 01:13:56,840
He's very concerned about the ethics

905
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:58,319
of this application.

906
01:13:58,399 --> 01:14:01,720
Also joining us today is
the creator of the Arsa app,

907
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,119
Mr. Carl Raman. Hello to you both.

908
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:06,479
-Hello.
-I'll jump straight into it.

909
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:10,199
Recently, certain images were published

910
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:15,079
by a user of this app
who asked a masseuse to come to a hotel.

911
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:19,760
But the images don't seem to depict
an ordinary massage therapist.

912
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,960
You can see for yourself.
Let's take a look.

913
01:14:25,479 --> 01:14:27,960
There. Those are the images in question.

914
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:31,000
Many people who see them may think

915
01:14:31,079 --> 01:14:35,600
that perhaps this is

916
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:36,720
not massage therapy.

917
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:43,039
If that's true, this is an illegal way
to use the app, isn't it, Minister?

918
01:14:44,039 --> 01:14:46,600
Well, we've all seen the images.

919
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,720
Frankly, I'm concerned

920
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:53,880
that this app is being used
as a front for finding illegal work,

921
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:59,479
and the app doesn't appear to implement
any preventative measures against this.

922
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:02,600
Superficially, the app seems
to let people help each other.

923
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,520
But since it's not regulated,

924
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,159
there's no way to know

925
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:09,159
if the jobs are inappropriate in any way.

926
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:12,279
The app is also used
for swapping lodgings.

927
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,479
We can't investigate or control

928
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:19,239
the quality and standard of the hotels
to make sure they meet tourists' needs.

929
01:15:19,319 --> 01:15:23,119
-It can cause some damage.
-Do you say this as a hotelier?

930
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:25,680
Well, business aside,

931
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,119
I'm focusing on the country overall

932
01:15:28,199 --> 01:15:31,560
because we had to win back
the trust of tourists

933
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:33,560
so that they'd visit us again after COVID,

934
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,239
and that wasn't easy at all.

935
01:15:35,319 --> 01:15:38,560
Now we have to face this issue too.
I think it's like salt in the wound.

936
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,000
The minister has had his say.

937
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:44,399
And you, Mr. Carl?
What do you say to the minister,

938
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:46,399
to the public, and to the viewers?

939
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:50,199
I admit that we're now seeing
fake accounts using certain services,

940
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,600
but they're the minority of accounts.

941
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:56,279
Our main goal is to have
volunteers spreading kindness

942
01:15:56,359 --> 01:15:59,239
and taking the time to make extra income.

943
01:15:59,319 --> 01:16:00,840
But if someone abuses the system,

944
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,520
we can cancel that volunteer's membership.

945
01:16:04,119 --> 01:16:08,199
I want everyone to see the app's benefits
which meet the needs of city people.

946
01:16:08,279 --> 01:16:11,000
In what ways?
Let me ask you on behalf of the viewers.

947
01:16:11,079 --> 01:16:15,159
Could you give us examples
or show us how it works?

948
01:16:15,239 --> 01:16:18,199
Yes, I can.
Today, I wanted to move to a new place.

949
01:16:18,279 --> 01:16:20,439
But I had to appear on this show.

950
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:23,359
I just needed someone
to help me move my stuff.

951
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,479
-You see?
-I see.

952
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,239
This is the volunteer
who's helping me move my stuff.

953
01:16:29,319 --> 01:16:33,880
We'll see

954
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:38,840
You know, the details here are very clear.
You can see the user's photo,

955
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,680
first and last name, and phone number.

956
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:43,560
Let's show the viewers what it looks like

957
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:47,119
inside the Arsa app
that we're talking about.

958
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:48,720
MRS. KASALONG SANGCHAI

959
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:53,039
I want everyone to see
that honest, helpful people still exist.

960
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:56,600
Now let's check and see
if this user is who they say they are.

961
01:16:56,680 --> 01:17:00,600
If this volunteer is not
Mrs. Kasalong Sangchai as they said,

962
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:03,239
my company is happy
to change for the better.

963
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:18,880
So, Mr. Carl, are you saying

964
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,119
that you have
a verification system that ensures

965
01:17:22,199 --> 01:17:25,039
that no one can covertly

966
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:28,159
engage in illegal activities on this app?

967
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:32,319
That depends on the intentions
and the judgment of the users.

968
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:34,560
It's like any ordinary dating app.

969
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,319
If both parties are willing
and give consent,

970
01:17:37,399 --> 01:17:39,960
we can't tar them with the same brush
as the con artists.

971
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,079
So you still insist

972
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:45,640
that you created this app
to help other people.

973
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:49,520
Yes, and I think
a lot more people can benefit from it.

974
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,439
Older people with no kids or grandkids

975
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,920
can get someone to help them
with tasks they can't do themselves.

976
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,800
Kids can find someone
to help them with their homework.

977
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:59,800
Also, older people and disabled people--

978
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,279
Sorry, may I interrupt? We're digressing.

979
01:18:02,359 --> 01:18:05,239
Of course there are advantages
and some good ideas,

980
01:18:05,319 --> 01:18:08,079
but we're concerned
about how it affects our nation.

981
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:10,760
If the app has no oversight,

982
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:13,199
criminals could infiltrate it.

983
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:14,600
That's my concern.

984
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:16,760
The minister has a point, Mr. Carl.

985
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,520
I think if people dedicated
a bit of their time to others,

986
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,479
this app could make this city better

987
01:18:22,079 --> 01:18:23,880
because no one would be left behind.

988
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,079
That's the app's view.

989
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:28,319
I'm speaking as
the Tourism and Sports Minister.

990
01:18:28,399 --> 01:18:31,319
I'm talking about the intention
behind creating my app.

991
01:18:31,399 --> 01:18:32,640
All right, everyone.

992
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,960
Let's calm down. It's getting intense.

993
01:18:35,039 --> 01:18:36,880
Let's take a short break.

994
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,319
Please don't miss the next segment

995
01:18:39,399 --> 01:18:41,920
because the volunteer we mentioned

996
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,880
will visit Mr. Carl here in our studio.

997
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,720
But for now, let's take a breather.

998
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:53,199
Excuse me. The moving truck's nearly here.

999
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:54,319
Right. Okay.

1000
01:18:54,399 --> 01:18:58,119
Remember, when the moving truck arrives,
cut to the live show again.

1001
01:18:58,199 --> 01:19:01,239
I'll take a camera downstairs
to wait for them.

1002
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,359
You kept digressing from the issue.

1003
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:05,880
I couldn't just let you accuse me.

1004
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,239
Mind what you say.

1005
01:19:12,199 --> 01:19:13,479
Remember, he's a minister.

1006
01:19:22,359 --> 01:19:23,479
Welcome back.

1007
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:27,279
And now,

1008
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:32,880
our volunteer is ready, and we'll see

1009
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:37,000
who registered as a user of this app.

1010
01:19:37,079 --> 01:19:38,239
-May I?
-Please go ahead.

1011
01:19:38,319 --> 01:19:40,039
Of course it'll be the same person.

1012
01:19:40,119 --> 01:19:44,199
If he's so confident,
he must have planned it all, right?

1013
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:46,920
We'll see if that's true.

1014
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,520
Please calm down.
We're about to find out the truth.

1015
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:52,960
Let's show the viewers the screen.

1016
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:54,119
I repeat,

1017
01:19:54,199 --> 01:19:55,840
if she's the same person,

1018
01:19:56,399 --> 01:20:01,960
she must be a housekeeper named
Mrs. Kasalong Sangchai, aged 45.

1019
01:20:02,039 --> 01:20:05,720
It says here
that she's from Chiang Rai Province.

1020
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,520
Let's find out

1021
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,000
if she's the same person.

1022
01:20:09,079 --> 01:20:11,039
Let's meet her in real life.

1023
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:24,680
Let's watch the live footage right now.

1024
01:20:30,199 --> 01:20:31,319
Here she is.

1025
01:20:46,439 --> 01:20:47,680
Why are we here?

1026
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,319
To see my boss, of course.

1027
01:21:03,399 --> 01:21:04,680
You betrayed me?

1028
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,479
You impersonated someone to trick us.

1029
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:21,840
Come on.

1030
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,840
Thailand's waiting.

1031
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:26,199
But why would she hide her face
behind her purse like that?

1032
01:21:28,279 --> 01:21:30,479
From what I can see, it's not her.

1033
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,960
You know, our app can use phone numbers
to verify our users' identities.

1034
01:21:34,039 --> 01:21:35,720
You could try calling her.

1035
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,119
All right, let me call this number now.

1036
01:21:38,199 --> 01:21:40,119
Let's see if she picks up.

1037
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:46,119
Her phone should be ringing.

1038
01:21:48,359 --> 01:21:49,720
-Khim.
-We can see her face.

1039
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:53,840
So did this person create a fake account
to impersonate someone

1040
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,159
for fraudulent purposes?

1041
01:21:55,239 --> 01:21:58,840
We'll have to ask her who she is
and why she's job hunting fraudulently.

1042
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:00,479
If she has bad intentions,

1043
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:02,039
I'm ready to press charges.

1044
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:06,000
This is incredible.
We've really hit the jackpot.

1045
01:22:06,079 --> 01:22:07,800
But Minister, don't you think

1046
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:09,920
she looks like a certain someone?

1047
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:11,840
She looks familiar.

1048
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,800
Isn't that your daughter, Minister?

1049
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:18,399
Maybe she wanted to have fun with our app,
so she used someone else's account.

1050
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:19,760
She's got a good background.

1051
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,079
I guess we can't call her a criminal.

1052
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:24,000
What do you think, Minister?

1053
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:27,760
Stop filming.

1054
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:29,479
Stop filming!

1055
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,720
Everyone, stop filming!

1056
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,279
Whoa, he's good.

1057
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:47,960
Don't be shy. Come out.

1058
01:22:48,039 --> 01:22:49,439
Be polite to the reporters.

1059
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,920
Don't you have manners?

1060
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,359
Come on!

1061
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:54,920
Stop filming!

1062
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:56,560
Stop filming now!

1063
01:22:58,560 --> 01:22:59,760
Why are you filming?

1064
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,560
You wanted an exposé.
Here it is. What are you afraid of?

1065
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:05,039
They're playing dirty.
They're scapegoating us!

1066
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,079
No filming! Do you hear me?

1067
01:23:07,159 --> 01:23:08,479
-Please film it!
-No filming!

1068
01:23:10,039 --> 01:23:10,960
I said, no filming!

1069
01:23:11,039 --> 01:23:13,079
Let's watch these developments.

1070
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,600
This is live from outside our studio.
Her face… there she is.

1071
01:23:17,119 --> 01:23:18,840
-I said, no filming!
-Film it!

1072
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:21,720
You tricked people. Now pay the price!

1073
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,119
-Stop. Get away!
-Go in there!

1074
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:25,039
-Hey! I said, no filming!
-Please stop.

1075
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:26,319
-Film it!
-I'm sorry.

1076
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:29,920
A lot is going on out there.
Let's come back to the studio.

1077
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,960
This incident has left me
almost speechless.

1078
01:23:33,039 --> 01:23:36,159
But we've almost
run out of time for today.

1079
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:38,000
So let's shift the focus over here.

1080
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:41,880
Before we go,
do you have anything to add, Minister?

1081
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:44,439
The app developers

1082
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,319
why they caused a scene today

1083
01:23:46,399 --> 01:23:47,840
and who they intend to hurt.

1084
01:23:49,159 --> 01:23:51,359
I've told you the intention
behind the app.

1085
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:55,399
It's the impostor's intentions
that caused this incident today.

1086
01:23:55,479 --> 01:23:58,279
I think we know now
whether the problem lies with the app

1087
01:23:58,359 --> 01:24:00,880
or with the impostors who use it.

1088
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:02,960
Well, dear viewers,

1089
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:06,119
our topic today is super intense.

1090
01:24:06,199 --> 01:24:07,159
Do stay tuned.

1091
01:24:07,239 --> 01:24:09,600
I'm sure there will be a sequel,
but for now, sadly,

1092
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:10,880
we're out of time.

1093
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,760
Thanks to both our guests. Thank you.

1094
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:13,760
Thank you.

1095
01:24:15,159 --> 01:24:16,000
And we…

1096
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:18,359
we'll say goodbye for today.

1097
01:24:18,439 --> 01:24:20,439
See you next time. Goodbye for now.

1098
01:24:23,439 --> 01:24:25,079
Well? Are you proud of yourself?

1099
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,800
She came to my place in disguise.

1100
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:31,840
She came onto me first. You didn't know?

1101
01:24:33,319 --> 01:24:35,239
I guess she's still not over me

1102
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,680
so she keeps trying to rehash our past.

1103
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,079
Get a hold of yourself.

1104
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:41,359
My poor father-in-law.

1105
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,399
He must be so ashamed.

1106
01:24:44,399 --> 01:24:45,600
Dad, don't listen to him.

1107
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:49,640
You've gone too far.

1108
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,199
You entrapped me.

1109
01:24:52,279 --> 01:24:53,880
I've been tricked, Dad.

1110
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:55,640
You've had a quiet life.

1111
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:57,239
Why did you look for trouble?

1112
01:24:58,159 --> 01:24:59,960
Your people played dirty with me first.

1113
01:25:00,039 --> 01:25:01,800
You used that masseuse against me.

1114
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:03,600
You're lucky I didn't expose you too.

1115
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:06,640
That's enough!

1116
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,239
You think this is enough to defeat me?

1117
01:25:12,319 --> 01:25:15,399
I'm just happy to humiliate you
in front of the media.

1118
01:25:24,359 --> 01:25:26,359
I'll destroy your facade.

1119
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:29,119
I'll show everyone

1120
01:25:30,119 --> 01:25:31,600
that you're nothing special.

1121
01:25:34,119 --> 01:25:34,960
Do it.

1122
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,479
Then I can be your former son-in-law.

1123
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,319
You treated me like mangy dog.

1124
01:25:41,399 --> 01:25:43,399
Maybe you're just a tick on that dog now.

1125
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:47,560
Well, my little girl?

1126
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:49,319
Happy now?

1127
01:26:00,479 --> 01:26:01,880
Let's talk properly.

1128
01:26:02,479 --> 01:26:03,960
You've gone way too far.

1129
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:05,920
Why didn't you tell the whole truth?

1130
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,680
You lured me towards you.

1131
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,640
You've used me all this time.

1132
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:10,760
In the end,

1133
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,359
do you just want to humiliate me?

1134
01:26:12,439 --> 01:26:14,680
Are you happy now,
or do you want to ruin me more?

1135
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:16,199
I'm not easily satisfied.

1136
01:26:16,279 --> 01:26:17,479
Let me tell you something.

1137
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,079
Getting revenge on you alone isn't enough.

1138
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:25,439
What did I do to you?

1139
01:26:26,079 --> 01:26:27,960
What made you want revenge on me?

1140
01:26:28,039 --> 01:26:29,840
I've also asked myself

1141
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:32,720
what I ever did to your family.

1142
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,600
I've asked myself that for years.

1143
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:37,239
If you just started asking that,
you're not doing enough.

1144
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:40,520
If I'm the problem,

1145
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,239
hurt me, but why would you hurt Dad?

1146
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,880
Your dad is the one who put me in prison!

1147
01:26:46,119 --> 01:26:47,920
How does it feel to be accused too?

1148
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,439
What your family did to me,

1149
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,039
I'll do it back to you all.

1150
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:56,760
But it might hurt you worse
if you never learn.

1151
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:29,760
If you want to get revenge on me,
leave other people out of it.

1152
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:30,880
What did I do to you?

1153
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,199
What made you want revenge on me?

1154
01:27:33,279 --> 01:27:35,000
If you don't seize this chance,

1155
01:27:35,079 --> 01:27:37,520
your life will never get better again.

1156
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,079
Tell him to go to hell!

1157
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:44,560
If you feel uncomfortable staying here,
you can come and work with me.

1158
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:47,399
Mom, this is Miss Khim, my idol.

1159
01:27:47,479 --> 01:27:50,159
But everyone said that Mom died.

1160
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:52,359
What did you make all these plans for?

1161
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,239
If you want to be cruel, do it properly.

1162
01:27:55,319 --> 01:27:56,479
Go in for the kill.

1163
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:58,880
All these ghosts are coming back to life.

1164
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,600
You want to make me hurt?

1165
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:01,680
If you do,

1166
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,279
you've succeeded.

1167
01:28:03,359 --> 01:28:04,640
I'm in pain.

1168
01:28:05,239 --> 01:28:06,439
Are you happy now?

1169
01:28:38,399 --> 01:28:41,399
