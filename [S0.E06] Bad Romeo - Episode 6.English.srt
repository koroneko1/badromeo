00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,400
THIS FICTIONAL SERIES IS INTENDED
FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY

2
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,080
You know, don't you, that Gla

3
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,759
isn't my own son?

4
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,080
His garage customizes tax-dodging cars,
so it's being raided.

5
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,000
If he's arrested,

6
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,840
Saikhim has nowhere to go.

7
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,000
Marry me, Khim.

8
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,039
I won't make you regret

9
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,919
giving up your future
to be with someone like me.

10
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,960
Today is the first day

11
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:07,080
of the rest of your lives
as lawfully wedded husband and wife.

12
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,520
Kissing practice.

13
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,800
You'll feel less awkward,
or you'll get punished.

14
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,879
You closed it?

15
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,120
Where's the money?

16
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,879
I gave it to Khem for his own--

17
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,360
I gave him all the money
'cause I got a power plant surveying gig.

18
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:21,039
I'll go to the forests of Laos
with the engineers.

19
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,439
I want to make all that money back
before our baby is born.

20
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,639
I have learned

21
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,039
that love is most fragile

22
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,599
when you have fears and doubts.

23
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,560
Love is strongest

24
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,960
when you have trust and certainty.

25
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,120
Well? What are you staring at?

26
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,479
What are you doing here?

27
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,360
I came to surprise you.

28
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,240
Surprise?

29
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,479
What if I'd died of shock?

30
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,439
Then you'd be a scary pregnant ghost.

31
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm not laughing.

32
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,120
Are you really mad?

33
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,600
I've missed you so much
for almost a month.

34
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,439
Please don't look so grumpy.

35
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,399
Let me see you.

36
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,199
Hey, put it down.

37
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,480
Why didn't you put on weight?

38
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Don't you eat?

39
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,319
Hey, kid, you're not too hungry, are you?

40
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,879
Mommy's not eating.

41
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,680
Why is Mommy like this?

42
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,279
It's okay, kid. Daddy's home.

43
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,560
Don't worry, you won't starve.
I've brought you something.

44
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,680
You've brought something?

45
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,839
I've replaced your broken one.

46
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,360
I have money now.

47
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,680
I'll pay it off for you.

48
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,560
Thank you.

49
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,959
I'll make good use of it.

50
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,480
I have to go back next week
to survey the potential tunnel site.

51
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,399
It'll be even harder work.

52
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,480
You're leaving again?

53
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,439
I'm here just one week.

54
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,439
I'll make you both nice and fat.

55
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,720
What?

56
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,759
What happened?

57
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,319
Why are your hands so filthy?

58
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,959
They're covered in dirt.

59
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,079
Well, I've been working.

60
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,759
I'm back now.

61
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,079
You can be a lady of leisure again.

62
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,360
Okay?

63
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,000
Work your magic, Mama Ooi.

64
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,959
-Sure.
-Make her hands soft again.

65
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,680
Make them smoother than my face.

66
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:35,639
You're newlyweds, right?
That's why you're so lovey-dovey.

67
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,120
Sorry, my honeymoon period will go on
for decades to come.

68
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,360
Decades?

69
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:43,680
Make it to the end of this year first.

70
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,879
Give me your hand.

71
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,120
What is it?

72
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,839
Is he seeing someone else?

73
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,000
Excuse me.

74
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes, Auntie Oon?

75
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,759
Miss Khim, I have some news.

76
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:31,959
I've heard that Mr. Seen isn't very well.

77
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,159
Is Dad all right?

78
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Your father had a fall.
It might be due to his blood pressure.

79
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,120
The doctor said he's at risk for a stroke.

80
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,840
How's Dad doing now?

81
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,120
He's just left the hospital.

82
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:51,080
I've heard he's going to stay
at a friend's plantation near yours.

83
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,320
Really?

84
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,919
Miss Khim, won't you go and visit him?

85
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,480
Does he really want to see me, Auntie Oon?

86
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,480
You knew the risks,
so why did you take this job?

87
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,679
How else could I make a living, bro?
I tried to open my garage and got scammed.

88
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,360
Will this be worth the risks?

89
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,799
Well, I accepted this job

90
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,799
because it's close to your home.

91
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,279
We'll just drive across the border.

92
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,919
Once we've delivered the stuff,
we'll get all the money, bro.

93
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,720
I can't do it.

94
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,639
I promised Khim I wouldn't do crime again.

95
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,080
Okay, bro.

96
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,559
I'll do it alone.

97
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:53,360
Khem, if you really have money problems,
I can find ways to borrow money for you.

98
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,159
Don't put yourself at risk, okay?

99
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,840
Don't worry, bro.

100
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,600
I don't want to trouble you again.

101
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,279
Hey, Khem…

102
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,679
I charged the battery for you.

103
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,759
You have to go to the forests prepared

104
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,159
so we can stay in touch.

105
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,080
I love having someone to worry about me.

106
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,799
Don't complain if I call you too often.

107
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,600
If only I could bring you
as a spare battery.

108
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,879
When I'm tired,
I think of you, and I feel stronger.

109
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,639
I don't know where that energy comes from.
I want you near me so you can recharge me.

110
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,360
In that case,

111
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,080
I'll fully recharge you right now.

112
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,639
What? I haven't been home long.
I need more time to recharge.

113
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,240
I'm still tired. What should we do?

114
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,519
Can I charge my spare battery?

115
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:26,720
You don't have to see me off.
Save yourself the long trip.

116
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,279
This is far enough.

117
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,440
Look after yourself.

118
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,279
Don't work too hard, Dad.

119
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:03,039
Hang on.

120
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,120
It's so cute, Khim.

121
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,200
Hurry back, okay?

122
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,639
You take care, okay?

123
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,080
You take care too.

124
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,919
Bye.

125
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,000
You want to see Daddy off, do you?

126
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,759
Gla!

127
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:20,159
Gla, the baby's moving.

128
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,200
Why are so many cops around today?

129
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,399
Is there trouble again?

130
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,120
Maybe there's
another counterfeit goods raid.

131
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,600
Khem.

132
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,240
-Let's go that way.
-What? Aren't we going to the border?

133
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,679
I need to do something. Turn that way.

134
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,039
Okay.

135
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:33,159
Hey, man, stop right here.

136
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,000
You can go now.

137
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,360
Khem! Are you around here?

138
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,039
Hey, Khem!

139
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:51,960
-Khem!
-Bro!

140
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,919
-What are you doing here?
-What are you waiting for?

141
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,639
There are checkpoints everywhere.

142
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,600
Don't take the car!

143
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,879
This gun, it was in the car.

144
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,360
Stop! Freeze!

145
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,159
Run, Khem!

146
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,399
Bro…

147
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,159
Don't move! Put the weapon down!

148
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:21,840
What should we do?

149
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:22,919
Give me the gun.

150
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,919
Don't move!

151
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,840
Freeze!

152
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,080
Put the weapon down slowly.

153
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,159
Hey!

154
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,039
-Khem, get in the car!
-Okay!

155
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,799
-Hey!
-Hey, bro!

156
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:02,840
Hey!

157
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,720
Hey!

158
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,400
Mr. Seen is staying in the area.

159
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,160
I heard that you were here, Miss Khim,

160
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,880
so I've come to bring you to him.

161
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:34,440
Does he really want me to see him?

162
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,200
I'm worried

163
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,839
that if he sees me,

164
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,319
he won't be able to cope.

165
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:57,079
How will we get away from them?

166
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,920
You wanna die in jail an old man?

167
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,960
Hey, what now, bro?

168
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,519
We have to leave the car.

169
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:14,839
Khem.

170
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,079
-Hey, here's our way out of this!
-Hey!

171
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,319
Gla! The cops!

172
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,920
-Stop!
-Stop! This is the police!

173
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:34,680
-Hey!
-Khem! Come on!

174
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,279
I'm coming, bro.

175
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:39,440
Stop!

176
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,920
Gla, hurry!

177
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,839
Come in. We need backup right now.
The suspects are fleeing by boat.

178
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:34,920
Move! Hurry!

179
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:36,559
Lock onto the target!

180
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,720
Hey! The cops!

181
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,319
Gla! The cops!

182
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,200
Turn, bro!

183
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,200
My family called.

184
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,799
Please stop here.

185
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,559
Uncle?

186
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,920
Is something wrong?

187
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,920
It's Gla. He didn't go to the border.

188
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:40,640
He's causing trouble again.

189
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:01,039
Please keep out. It's dangerous.

190
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,079
Please keep out. It's dangerous.

191
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,920
-Gla!
-I'm coming too.

192
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,640
-Gla!
-Don't enter.

193
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,799
Officers! My son is there!

194
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,319
-Sir, it's dangerous.
-Can I go in there?

195
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,799
No, ma'am. It's dangerous.

196
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:20,839
We've surrounded the suspects.
They won't get away.

197
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,960
We're doomed!

198
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:25,880
Surrender now!

199
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,480
-Be careful, Miss Khim.
-Keep out.

200
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,200
-Please let me in.
-No, it's too dangerous.

201
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,880
Fire!

202
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,160
Khem!

203
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,359
A suspect has been shot.

204
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,119
Gla.

205
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,240
Put your hands up!

206
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:03,640
You're not getting away!

207
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,640
Get on the boat!

208
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,559
Move! Hurry!

209
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,640
Uncle?

210
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,519
If they refuse to be taken alive,
we'll take them dead.

211
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:01,920
Khem!

212
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,799
Khem! Wake up!

213
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:10,440
Stop!

214
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,519
Don't you dare give up!

215
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,079
Put your hands up and surrender!

216
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,000
Khem!

217
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,279
Don't leave me like this!

218
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,720
Attention.

219
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,680
Our informant is dying.

220
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,440
Informant?

221
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,079
We just want Saikhim back,

222
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,039
and we want Gaogla
to admit that he abducted her.

223
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:45,720
Then we'll find ways to help you
with your vehicle fraud case.

224
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,400
Get Gaogla to surrender
and let the man have his daughter back

225
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,240
if you don't want a life sentence.

226
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:01,559
I'm sorry.

227
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:06,000
Listen! We've seized all the evidence!

228
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:09,440
The case against you is ironclad.
Give yourself up now!

229
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,119
How could you?

230
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:15,759
-Why did you do it?
-I didn't think it would end like this.

231
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,680
I'm sorry, bro.

232
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:21,680
Do not resist arrest or try to flee!

233
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:23,559
Why did you do it?

234
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:32,559
If I can't be good,
I'll just give up and be bad!

235
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,079
Let's go.

236
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,240
Out of our way, please.

237
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,599
Out of our way, please.

238
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,000
Dad?

239
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,279
How are you?

240
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:30,599
What about Gla?

241
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,519
All our actions have consequences.

242
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,559
So, is Gla safe?

243
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:40,839
-I have to see him!
-Khim.

244
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,359
You have to stay here.

245
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,480
Listen.

246
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,720
Even if he survives,
he won't stay out of jail.

247
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:48,640
You as well.

248
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,960
He could drag you down with him
if you don't leave him.

249
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,759
Gla did nothing wrong, Dad.

250
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,480
He promised me
that he'd change for the better.

251
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:59,599
People who are used to living recklessly

252
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,599
promise to change their ways,

253
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:04,680
but do you know
what they're doing behind your back?

254
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:10,160
Here.

255
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:11,680
Take a look.

256
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,680
He threatened

257
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,880
to make this public.

258
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,720
And he said that your unborn baby

259
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,359
will not be his responsibility.

260
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,839
That's why he distanced himself from you.

261
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:28,920
That's not true.

262
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,359
-It's not true. I need to see him, Dad!
-Khim.

263
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,039
Khim, listen to me.

264
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,960
You don't even know him that well.

265
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,400
You don't love him. You never did.
It's just an infatuation.

266
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,759
That's not true.

267
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:45,759
-Khim.
-No!

268
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:48,400
-Gla!
-You don't love him. You're infatuated.

269
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,039
It's only infatuation. Trust me.

270
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:51,039
Trust me.

271
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:55,720
I won't let you go.

272
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,720
He must pay for what he did.

273
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,319
Dad.

274
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,119
Your assistant, Khem, is safe now.

275
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,319
What about Khim?

276
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,920
Her father took her away.

277
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,559
I've been framed.

278
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:26,480
They set me up to arrest me
so that he could take Khim back.

279
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,079
We seized this evidence.

280
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:35,519
You accepted this job.

281
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,240
You still saying you were set up?

282
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,720
Question him at the station.

283
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:19,119
-Hey!
-Gla!

284
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,519
-The suspect is escaping.
-Gla!

285
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:30,319
-Seal the exits now!
-Gla!

286
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,160
Stop!

287
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,599
Stop! Put down the scissors!

288
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:51,960
Put them down!

289
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,799
Put them down!

290
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:06,640
You did this, didn't you?

291
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:12,039
-Khim.
-Gla!

292
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:15,039
You framed me! Khim, don't listen to him!

293
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:17,079
I did nothing wrong.

294
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:18,880
You can't pin this on me!

295
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:20,759
They want us apart!

296
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:24,359
I promised Khim.
Why would I break my promise to her?

297
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,519
Don't mess with us!

298
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:27,839
-Stay out of this!
-Stop it!

299
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,640
Put the scissors down!

300
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,519
They used Khem to entrap me
then tried to kill him to shut him up!

301
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:36,920
Are you nuts?

302
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,160
Put your hands up and surrender!

303
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,759
Well, arrest him!
His people are the ones who hired me!

304
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,279
Or did he bribe you?

305
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:49,880
-Is that why you're doing nothing?
-Final warning.

306
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,720
Don't make us use excessive force!

307
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:57,880
Hey, please don't hurt him!

308
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,799
Khim.

309
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,640
Do you believe that I was framed?

310
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:04,640
One!

311
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:07,720
-I believe you.
-Two!

312
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,799
Then come back. Come to me!

313
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:13,400
Three!

314
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,799
-Don't shoot him!
-Khim, no!

315
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:25,119
Honey, he's using you!

316
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,119
I didn't do it.

317
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,880
I swear!

318
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,119
Don't you see he's holding her hostage?

319
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,519
Khim, do you trust me?

320
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:39,839
Please don't do this.

321
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,160
We'll figure it out together.

322
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,079
Okay?

323
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,359
What are you doing?

324
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,839
Why are you afraid?

325
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,759
Do you think I'd hurt you?

326
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,400
Gla!

327
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,480
-He'll kill my daughter!
-Mr. Seen, no!

328
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,079
-They're just talking!
-Gla!

329
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:02,920
Gla.

330
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,400
Please don't do this.

331
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,240
Do I seem that awful?

332
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,039
It hurts like I'm being stabbed

333
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,880
when you look at me like that.

334
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,200
Wanna know how much it hurts?

335
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,519
Gla.

336
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:25,319
-Please let go.
-Khim.

337
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,359
I'm begging you.

338
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:29,119
-Let go, Khim.
-Gla.

339
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,039
Gla, calm down.

340
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,000
Gla!

341
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,759
Gla, calm down.

342
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:39,680
Don't do this.

343
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:41,640
-I'm scared, Gla.
-Let go, Khim.

344
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:44,200
-Gla, that's enough!
-Khim!

345
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,880
-Mr. Seen, no!
-Gla, calm down.

346
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,559
Gla, that's enough!

347
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,519
Don't!

348
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,720
Gloy!

349
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,480
-Gloy!
-It'll be okay, honey.

350
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:05,119
Officers! My daughter has been shot!

351
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,039
Who hurt my sister? Why did you shoot her?

352
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,880
-Gloy!
-Miss Khim!

353
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,800
Gloy!

354
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,719
-Gloy!
-Stop!

355
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,039
Why did you hurt her? Gloy!

356
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,559
-Gloy!
-Gloy!

357
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,239
Let me go!

358
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,320
Why did you hurt her?

359
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,679
-Gloy!
-Hurry, sir!

360
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,599
Gloy!

361
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,360
You'll be okay, honey.

362
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,000
Gloy!

363
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,320
Am I bad enough for you now?

364
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,679
My only mistake was falling
for a woman like you!

365
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:35,480
She doesn't eat,
she doesn't sleep, and she doesn't speak.

366
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,519
If we let this go on,

367
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,039
her body won't be able to take it, sir.

368
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,039
The doctor said it's stress.

369
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,400
It's affecting her body.

370
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,119
If her mood improves,
everything will be fine.

371
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,280
She doesn't seem
like she'll be able to get over it.

372
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,639
If she stays like this until the birth,

373
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,920
she won't be able to get through it.

374
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
We have to help her somehow, sir.

375
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,800
I want my daughter back as she was.

376
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,760
Dad.

377
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,920
Dad.

378
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:26,719
How is Gloy, Dad?

379
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:29,559
Still unconscious.

380
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,840
Stay strong.

381
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,599
I'll use the plantation deed
to get a loan to bail you out.

382
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,039
Dad, you haven't even asked me
if I really did it.

383
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,800
I raised you myself.

384
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,960
Of course I know what you're like.

385
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,679
Even if you did do it,

386
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,880
it wouldn't change
the fact that we are father and son.

387
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,199
No matter what you do,

388
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,400
I will always protect you.

389
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,280
Why are you so good to me, Dad?

390
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,840
I'm not even your real son.

391
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,119
Gloy is the one you should help.

392
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,480
You shouldn't be saddled with
a crappy son like me.

393
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,800
If you were bad,

394
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,559
they wouldn't hurt you like this.

395
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:40,159
They did it because you're good.

396
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,280
Much too good.

397
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,280
If no one loved you,

398
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,800
I would still love you,
and I'd always be there for you.

399
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:00,639
If anyone doesn't love you
for who you are,

400
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:03,400
maybe

401
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:06,000
it's not real love.

402
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,400
I'm sorry, Dad.

403
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:49,079
Gla.

404
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,800
Please don't do this.

405
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,639
Do I seem that awful?

406
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:55,719
He threatened to make this public.

407
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,960
And he said that your unborn baby

408
00:39:58,039 --> 00:39:59,599
will not be his responsibility.

409
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,400
It hurts like I'm being stabbed

410
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,119
when you look at me like that.

411
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,280
Wanna know how much it hurts?

412
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,840
Gla!

413
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,400
Am I bad enough for you now?

414
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,760
My only mistake was falling
for a woman like you!

415
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,719
If you want to trust me with your life,
we must trust each other.

416
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,599
Then we'll both survive.

417
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:38,559
Hey!

418
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:44,519
Is it okay?

419
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:46,599
I'd like you to give me sole custody.

420
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:49,800
I can raise just one kid.

421
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,320
Could you show me

422
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,719
how you'll raise it?

423
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,400
If you can cope with raising it,
I'll give you sole custody.

424
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:04,480
Go on.

425
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,199
Bro.

426
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:30,360
I'm sorry

427
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,360
that I had to betray you.

428
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,960
Those bastards tricked me

429
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:39,320
into luring you out.

430
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,320
They told me

431
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,519
that if you gave them Saikhim back,

432
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,679
they'd make our case go away.

433
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:54,760
They just wanted revenge.

434
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,480
Maybe they even wanted to kill me.

435
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,239
You suffered because of me.

436
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,800
No, bro.

437
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,320
Bro, don't say that.

438
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,280
Just hit me, bro.

439
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,599
Come on, hit me, bro!

440
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:13,800
I deserve it for betraying you!

441
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,400
Come on, hit me, bro!

442
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,800
Bro!

443
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,639
Bro!

444
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:21,559
Gla!

445
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:24,159
Just kick me, bro!

446
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,960
Kick me, bro!

447
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,559
You son of a bitch!

448
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:35,639
You want to go back
to the way we were, do you?

449
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,719
Khem!

450
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:41,199
Dad and Gloy have nothing to do with this.

451
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,760
Why did we burden them with this crap?

452
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,039
It's my damn fault, bro.

453
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,400
-What do you want me to do?
-They did nothing wrong.

454
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,000
We can't bring them into this crappy life.

455
00:42:55,079 --> 00:43:01,639
Do you know how much
Dad and Gloy have suffered because of me?

456
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:04,280
How can I ever face them again now?

457
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,119
-How, Khem?
-Bro.

458
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:09,400
Is this all our lives will ever be?

459
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,840
SEVEN YEARS AGO

460
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,280
JUVENILE HALL

461
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,199
Hey!

462
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,760
Snobby, aren't you, new guy?

463
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,639
Go on!

464
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:25,960
Learn to respect your elders.

465
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:30,480
Arrogant, are you?

466
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:40,400
Hey! What the hell were you looking at?

467
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,719
You want more hazing?

468
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:48,360
Hey, assholes.

469
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:53,360
If you're hungry,
come get your asses kicked.

470
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,039
-Come on.
-Come here.

471
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:01,000
You piece of trash!

472
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:03,159
What the hell are you looking at?

473
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:04,239
Hey, it's happening!

474
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,320
Let's do this, you sons of bitches!

475
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,519
What the hell do you want?

476
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:10,679
Hey! If you're not eating it, I will!

477
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,039
If you're too proud today,
you'll starve for weeks

478
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:24,760
unless you flatter those bastards.

479
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:29,960
Hey, he's scoffing it down like a dog!

480
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:31,800
What a piece of crap!

481
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,159
You can be a snob
if you don't mind starving to death.

482
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:38,960
This is nothing
compared to what you'll face later.

483
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,559
If you want to be an asshole,
you have to be a crazy one like me

484
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,159
so everyone leaves you alone.

485
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,920
All right. Hangry now, are you?

486
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,960
I'll kick your ass!

487
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:07,679
Hey, dude!

488
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,599
Don't!

489
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,760
This is not what I meant!

490
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:14,199
Dude!

491
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,639
Hey, dude!

492
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,639
Never forget.

493
00:45:23,719 --> 00:45:25,880
Being fed at all is a blessing.

494
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,719
We're juvenile delinquents.

495
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,679
Life won't get any better.

496
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,039
Don't ask for more than you deserve.

497
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,559
We nearly achieved something good.

498
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:43,480
Why?

499
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:46,599
Why do we keep getting stuck here?

500
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,880
I'm sorry, bro.

501
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,679
Gla.

502
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,960
I'm sorry, bro.

503
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:39,800
Auntie Oon, please help my baby.

504
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,519
The doctor's here. Please don't worry.

505
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:46,119
Please don't worry.

506
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:49,519
Family members out, please.
You can wait outside, ma'am.

507
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,119
Saikhim, can you tell me where it hurts?

508
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,599
Can you point to where it hurts?

509
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,760
-Khim, how are you?
-Sir! Miss Khim's hemorrhaging.

510
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,880
The doctor said
it's a threatened miscarriage.

511
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,320
Her hormone levels
have dropped dramatically.

512
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,519
The only way to save the child is
to treat her with hormones.

513
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:19,559
How is she, Doctor?

514
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:22,559
The patient is still bleeding.

515
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:25,320
We can still see the baby's vital signs.

516
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,639
If we give her hormones,
we could save the baby--

517
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,159
What about its mother's life?

518
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:35,519
If she keeps bleeding, that's troubling.
It could lead to a secondary infection.

519
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,440
My daughter still has a future.
Doctor, keep her safe. Do what you must.

520
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:41,440
If we must choose,

521
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:42,599
I choose my daughter.

522
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:45,199
What about the baby?

523
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,880
Any parent would love their child.

524
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,519
At this point,
who could be more important than Saikhim?

525
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,599
But would Miss Khim consent?

526
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,039
Maybe this is the baby's fate.

527
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,679
Just do your best, Doctor.

528
00:47:57,199 --> 00:47:59,679
If we really can't save it,
we'll have to accept that.

529
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:03,280
We have to salvage Saikhim's future.

530
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,920
And in ten years,
she'll be grateful she survived today.

531
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,440
Can I count on you, Doctor?

532
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:13,360
Yes, sir.

533
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:49,920
Did you know that when I was little,

534
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:51,800
I would pretend to be asleep

535
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:56,000
so that you'd pick me up
and take me to my bed?

536
00:48:56,599 --> 00:48:59,840
But you never did that, not even once.

537
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,280
Forget picking me up.

538
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,320
You probably don't even want
to look at me anymore.

539
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,840
I'm sorry.

540
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:03,480
It's all right,

541
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,360
my good girl.

542
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,920
Following the arrest of suspects
in the car import tax fraud case

543
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,039
at the border several days ago,

544
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:38,760
the court found
the men had tried to evade capture

545
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,920
and had previously been involved
in an illegal car importation case.

546
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,559
Therefore, the court ordered
that the men be detained without bail.

547
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:49,440
The Department of Special Investigation
and the Customs Department will both…

548
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,679
Khim?

549
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:54,639
Are you awake?

550
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:56,440
How are you?

551
00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:01,280
Khim, it's all over now.
You don't have to worry anymore.

552
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,719
That child

553
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,760
went to a better place.

554
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:15,760
Don't blame yourself.

555
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,280
It's not your fault.

556
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,639
You did your best, as any mom would do.

557
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,239
You see,

558
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:36,400
your dad was worried
you wouldn't be able to take the news,

559
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:38,199
so he asked me to come.

560
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,280
Now that you're awake,
I'll go and tell the nurse.

561
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,800
I'll be back.

562
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:48,519
Wait.

563
00:51:51,639 --> 00:51:53,760
Lita, can you help me out?

564
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,840
I want to talk to Gla.

565
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,159
I don't want to believe

566
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:04,519
that he's lied to me this whole time.

567
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,880
Okay.

568
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,800
Khim is awake.

569
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,440
She says she's very hungry, Auntie Oon.

570
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:38,760
Really? I'm so glad to hear that.

571
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,079
-Then I'll go and order some food.
-Sure.

572
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,400
Saikhim is so lucky

573
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,760
to have such a nice friend.

574
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,320
Uncle Seen must be so generous

575
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,119
to let you keep seeing her.

576
00:52:54,199 --> 00:52:57,360
Friends are our chosen family.
Have you never heard that?

577
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,119
But it's not so odd

578
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:02,679
that Khim would be closer to a friend
than to her own family.

579
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,519
Really? I thought you wanted to be
a member of our family.

580
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,760
I'm Cousin Prom.

581
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:13,639
Prom what?

582
00:53:13,719 --> 00:53:14,800
Prompat, sweetie.

583
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:42,840
Auntie Oonruean, I'm going downstairs
to find something to eat.

584
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:44,719
Please go ahead.

585
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,639
I'll come too.

586
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:54,119
Want another bite?

587
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,960
Don't you want more?

588
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,360
Khim?

589
00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:02,960
Are you full?

590
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,079
You're finished already?
Let me put that away.

591
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:12,480
Very well done. You nearly finished it.

592
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,000
-Yes.
-Let me put that away.

593
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:17,119
It's okay, Auntie Oon. I'll do it.

594
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,719
-Thank you.
-Sure.

595
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:22,840
Shall we get some food?

596
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,599
Okay.

597
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:36,840
What are you doing?

598
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,559
It's the dinner menu.
Khim asked me to order something.

599
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:55,760
All right. Please go ahead.

600
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,079
INPATIENT FOOD MENU

601
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:25,719
I'm going to England with Khim.

602
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,440
You take care of business here.

603
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,159
Don't worry about work.

604
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,239
Worry about this.

605
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:36,360
My people at the jail told me

606
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,159
that a stranger visited Gaogla.

607
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,239
Uncle, can you guess who?

608
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:52,559
Hello, I'd like to visit
Mr. Gaogla Chayodom.

609
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:53,599
Please open your bag.

610
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:00,719
I knew that annoying girl would betray us.

611
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,159
I've brought news.

612
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,000
I don't think you'll like it.

613
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:17,400
Your baby is gone.

614
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:22,159
Is that good news or bad?

615
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,800
Khim wants to talk to you,
so she wrote you a letter.

616
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:31,280
She wants to hear the truth
from you and no one else.

617
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:38,079
I miscarried a few days ago.

618
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,880
I couldn't let it be born
to a father like you.

619
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,519
Since you brought us shame,

620
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,639
it's better that the baby not be born
to bear that shame.

621
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:52,400
I need to get my life back.

622
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:55,039
The time we've had,

623
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:59,199
consider it payment for the bad deeds
we committed in our past lives.

624
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,079
I don't want to sink any lower.

625
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,760
Now I know we're too different.

626
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,840
If you can still behave like a gentleman,
please sign our divorce papers.

627
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:19,800
I want a clean break.

628
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,039
After we sign the papers,
we can go our separate ways.

629
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:26,960
I'm not asking too much, am I?

630
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,079
I guess she wants to get rid of me fast.

631
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:53,519
Khim's worried about you.

632
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:55,639
She's worried I won't die!

633
00:57:55,719 --> 00:57:58,239
Hey! I'm just the messenger.

634
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,039
Just write your reply.

635
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:02,840
Tell her to come here
if she wants a divorce.

636
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,559
I'm in jail because of her.

637
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:07,719
Why do I have to throw my life away here?

638
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:12,079
If she loved herself,
why would she resort to this?

639
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,639
She can go live where she wants.

640
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:17,239
But she can't just act
like my life means nothing!

641
00:58:53,079 --> 00:58:54,239
What have you two done?

642
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,400
I gave you access to this home

643
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,320
so that Saikhim could vent to you.

644
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:06,159
But you betrayed me.

645
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:08,000
You tried to help them make up.

646
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:11,360
So this means yesterday's letter…

647
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,519
It was fake.

648
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:19,280
-Guard, show her in.
-This way, please.

649
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,639
GAOGLA

650
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,679
Tell her to come here
if she wants a divorce.

651
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,519
No wonder he mentioned a divorce.

652
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,159
You switched the letters.

653
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:38,920
You know very well
that he's not good enough for Saikhim!

654
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,079
Why would you help them rehash this?

655
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,519
Why did you do this?

656
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,599
If you really wanted the best for Saikhim,

657
00:59:47,639 --> 00:59:51,119
you'd protect her
from that good-for-nothing man!

658
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,119
You're the only one

659
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:02,960
who knows all about Saikhim.

660
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,679
If you promise me
that you'll keep everything secret

661
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,960
and keep him out of Saikhim's life,

662
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:13,039
I promise

663
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:16,039
I'll pay for you
to study in England with her.

664
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:31,360
Yes, you're uncomfortable.

665
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,119
It's like betraying your friend.

666
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:36,079
But you know, deep down,

667
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:38,760
that he's not suitable for Saikhim at all.

668
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,440
Good friends want the best for each other.

669
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,360
Isn't that right?

670
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:49,760
Prove to me
that you're truly Saikhim's friend.

671
01:00:51,159 --> 01:00:53,280
Have fun with your new life.

672
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,320
Here's a map and the keys. There.

673
01:00:57,079 --> 01:00:59,920
I got this phone for you
as a surprise present.

674
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,719
Hey, I signed you up to a dating service
and picked five local guys for you.

675
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,079
Why is this happening to me?

676
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:14,360
I never should have let this happen, Lita.

677
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,159
-How could I let this happen?
-It's not your fault, Khim.

678
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,760
It's my fault.
I brought those men into your life.

679
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,159
You got her pregnant,

680
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,760
but that doesn't mean you own her.

681
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,320
What century are we in?

682
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,039
Don't use the baby
to bring her down to your level.

683
01:01:41,719 --> 01:01:42,920
If I hadn't been careless,

684
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,159
you'd never have slept with her.

685
01:01:46,679 --> 01:01:47,920
Remember this.

686
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,599
Never dare to touch
this forbidden fruit, ever.

687
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:57,480
If you promise me
you'll keep him out of Saikhim's life,

688
01:01:58,119 --> 01:01:59,159
I promise

689
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,239
I'll pay for you
to study in England with her.

690
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:22,920
He said

691
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:25,039
he wants a divorce.

692
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,599
Really?

693
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:35,840
An actual divorce?

694
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,559
He said he doesn't wanna rehash things.

695
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:44,920
He doesn't care anymore.

696
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,280
He doesn't want to explain anymore.

697
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:59,239
No matter what you think of him,
he doesn't care anymore.

698
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,440
It all started because of me,

699
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,199
and it'll end with me.

700
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:29,360
No one wanted that child,
so it should all end here.

701
01:03:32,719 --> 01:03:35,039
TRAISIT'S CASH ON WHEELS
TRADE YOUR CARS FOR CASH

702
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:36,559
-Let's go now.
-All right.

703
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,480
Hey, watch out!

704
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:40,159
Hey!

705
01:03:41,719 --> 01:03:42,559
It's my fault

706
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:44,960
for thinking money didn't matter.

707
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:47,840
Counselor, who knows
if this money will help Gla's case?

708
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,480
And now I don't even have
enough money to fight this case.

709
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:54,239
Use this money to get Gla back.

710
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:17,840
The prosecutor found the money
that was transferred into this account.

711
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,840
That money

712
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,440
will be used to prove
that you've been part of this operation.

713
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:25,880
We won't be acquitted this time.

714
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:17,119
Following the arrest of suspects
in the car import tax fraud case

715
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:18,920
at the border several days ago,

716
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,719
the court found
that the men had tried to evade capture

717
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:25,320
and had previously been involved
in an illegal car importation case.

718
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,760
Therefore, the court ordered
that the men be detained without bail.

719
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:42,000
You father's selling the plantation
to fight this case for you.

720
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:44,159
He said this is the last-ditch attempt.

721
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,519
What's the point of helping me?

722
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,480
He should use that money
to save Gloy's life instead.

723
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,519
About the money, he said

724
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:58,320
he can make more while he's alive,
but he only has one son,

725
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,880
so he has to get you back.

726
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:06,320
I give up.

727
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,719
Let's not fight it anymore.

728
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,159
This last bit of money is more useful
for my little sister.

729
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:16,920
If Dad keeps doing this,

730
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:23,679
even if I repay him my whole life,
I don't know if it will ever be enough.

731
01:07:36,679 --> 01:07:39,920
Dad, please stop trying to help me.

732
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:42,199
Since Mom's death,

733
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,480
you've suffered so much because of me.

734
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:47,039
From now on,

735
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,239
please let me do my duty as your son.

736
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:56,000
I want you to be comfortable,
to have everything you need,

737
01:07:56,719 --> 01:07:58,920
and to hold your head up high.

738
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,119
Keep your plantation.

739
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,960
Don't waste it on this wayward son.

740
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:05,559
This money

741
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,280
is my way of paying my debt.

742
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:10,440
Use it to save Gloy.

743
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:13,079
Gloy!

744
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:15,800
Gloy, honey!

745
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:30,239
If she survives,
pay for her to go to good schools

746
01:08:31,079 --> 01:08:32,319
so she'll get a degree.

747
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,159
You could buy a big new car.

748
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:45,840
All my life,

749
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,640
I've never made you proud.

750
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:50,600
This might be my last chance

751
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:52,680
to do something for you.

752
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,560
Who knows what will happen next?

753
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,319
If reincarnation is real,

754
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,439
I hope I get to be your son again.

755
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:10,199
Maybe then we'll truly be father and son.

756
01:10:01,399 --> 01:10:05,279
I'll never love you less.
I'll only love you more every day.

757
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,920
What if you stopped loving me?
What would happen?

758
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,239
I won't stop loving you.

759
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,000
DELETE FILE

760
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:17,920
DELETING

761
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,279
Am I bad enough for you now?

762
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,640
My only mistake was falling
for a woman like you!

763
01:11:46,439 --> 01:11:48,640
Hey! What's with all this noise?

764
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:51,640
Go to sleep! I told you to go to sleep!

765
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:52,560
Yes, sir.

766
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,439
Bro.

767
01:12:35,119 --> 01:12:35,960
Look at that.

768
01:12:38,039 --> 01:12:39,720
Who says jailbirds are useless?

769
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,680
At least those guys can earn money
for their families from here.

770
01:12:44,039 --> 01:12:44,880
I've heard

771
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,760
that an order came in.

772
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:49,319
They can earn money by selling organs.

773
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,119
If your organ is a match,

774
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,720
they'll pay through the nose.

775
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,279
They don't care who you are.

776
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,199
Gla!

777
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:09,439
Gla.

778
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:12,119
Come back.

779
01:13:13,399 --> 01:13:14,439
Gla.

780
01:13:52,279 --> 01:13:54,680
Gaogla has hanged himself in jail.

781
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:59,359
To run away from his problems?
I never thought he'd be such a coward.

782
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:02,760
It's like he knew
we've been arranging his divorce.

783
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,000
What's going on?

784
01:14:19,239 --> 01:14:21,279
Did something happen to Gaogla?

785
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,560
What happened?

786
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,000
Dad, please just tell me.

787
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:31,439
What happened, Dad?

788
01:14:32,199 --> 01:14:36,399
Dad, please tell me.
I'm begging you. I want to know.

789
01:14:36,479 --> 01:14:37,840
Dad, please tell me.

790
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,760
Please, Dad? Please just tell me.

791
01:14:47,479 --> 01:14:48,600
He attempted suicide

792
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:50,039
in jail.

793
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,119
His condition is serious.

794
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,479
We don't know if he'll live.

795
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,600
How did it end up like this?

796
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:22,720
I…

797
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:23,960
-I have to see him.
-Khim.

798
01:15:24,039 --> 01:15:25,079
-Miss Khim.
-Khim.

799
01:15:25,159 --> 01:15:26,560
-You can't go anywhere.
-Don't.

800
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,000
-No.
-Listen to me, honey.

801
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:29,680
Khim.

802
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:31,600
Khim.

803
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:33,960
Listen, honey.

804
01:15:36,439 --> 01:15:37,640
You must forget him.

805
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:40,840
You have to forget him!

806
01:15:43,479 --> 01:15:45,600
Even better, act like you never knew him.

807
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,720
Start living your life again.

808
01:15:50,319 --> 01:15:51,159
Dad.

809
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,960
We're going to move him
to scan his brain, sir.

810
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,359
We have the results now.

811
01:17:07,439 --> 01:17:09,159
They are a match.

812
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:14,279
Our doctor is prepping the operating room
for the kidney transplant.

813
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:32,720
They found this contract in the jail.
Someone smuggled it to us.

814
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:39,600
What does this mean?

815
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:43,520
Your son has chosen
to give his organs to these traffickers

816
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,520
and will receive something in return.

817
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:47,319
But that's illegal.

818
01:17:47,399 --> 01:17:49,720
I don't understand
this crazy situation either.

819
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,800
That's a person's whole life.
They can't just trade it!

820
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,079
I hope he'll survive.

821
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:57,119
But if he doesn't,
you should think about it.

822
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,520
Would you let him die for nothing?

823
01:18:01,159 --> 01:18:04,560
We're going to move him
to scan his brain, sir.

824
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:07,239
They were going to scan his brain.

825
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,560
Gla!

826
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:21,520
Where is he going?

827
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,000
What are you doing here?

828
01:18:39,079 --> 01:18:41,640
He's my husband's illegitimate son.

829
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:44,399
So it's you.

830
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:46,319
You followed us.

831
01:18:47,159 --> 01:18:48,439
You can't take him anywhere.

832
01:18:49,159 --> 01:18:52,760
You hid him away for decades
and couldn't take good care of him!

833
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:53,920
I'm taking him!

834
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,880
But he's still alive.
He could still wake up.

835
01:18:57,479 --> 01:18:59,039
I'm not going to kill him!

836
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:02,039
I just want him
to help save my son's life!

837
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:03,760
Well, he's my son too.

838
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,199
Do you have any morals?

839
01:19:06,279 --> 01:19:08,399
He wasn't born
to be someone's spare parts.

840
01:19:09,079 --> 01:19:12,159
No matter how bad life is,
he has the right to live.

841
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:13,680
All of us

842
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:15,960
have one life each.

843
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,840
Your money can't dictate
someone else's life.

844
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:24,119
He will never wake up

845
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,399
because his wife

846
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:29,199
has already prepared
his treatment refusal forms.

847
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:31,199
If anything happens,

848
01:19:31,279 --> 01:19:33,560
he'll be left to wait to die.

849
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,159
No one can save him.

850
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:43,640
Those people are the ones
who are going to kill him.

851
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:50,880
I will not lose this chance

852
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,039
because without him,

853
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,960
my son will not live.

854
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:59,920
If someone has to die,
someone else should at least get to live.

855
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,800
It's better than both of them dying.

856
01:21:22,439 --> 01:21:23,960
That's Nate, my son.

857
01:21:25,319 --> 01:21:27,640
He had a mountain climbing accident.

858
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:30,159
He never regained consciousness.

859
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:35,720
We used equipment to support him

860
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,920
and brought him here
to buy time and wait for a miracle.

861
01:21:39,439 --> 01:21:42,199
To me, your son is that miracle

862
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:45,960
because three days ago,
Nate had kidney failure.

863
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:56,039
Tissue forceps, please.

864
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,199
Your son is in great danger.

865
01:22:02,279 --> 01:22:03,840
You really think he'll survive?

866
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,600
How many days will Gla buy him, huh?

867
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:08,600
I'll buy as many days as I can

868
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:11,079
because Nate grew up
with this deadly condition

869
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:12,560
and he's survived this long.

870
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:16,279
He needs a liver today.
Maybe tomorrow it'll be a lung or a heart.

871
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,199
Let me tell you something.

872
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:22,439
Gla

873
01:22:23,479 --> 01:22:25,319
is a miracle to me too.

874
01:22:28,279 --> 01:22:29,760
He tried to kill himself,

875
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,359
meaning he didn't want
to donate just his kidney.

876
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:39,000
He wanted to save his sister's life
by giving his own in exchange.

877
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,079
That's the kind of heart

878
01:22:44,199 --> 01:22:45,760
that deserves to be loved,

879
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,039
not destroyed.

880
01:22:50,439 --> 01:22:51,920
That miracle of yours

881
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,359
is his heart!

882
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:58,680
He has had to live in the shadows

883
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:02,560
to hide from a father
who doesn't treat him like a human.

884
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,560
He got arrested after being bullied
for not being my own son.

885
01:23:07,079 --> 01:23:09,479
We've ruined their childhood

886
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:12,039
by making them face grown-up problems.

887
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,359
We've acted like we own them.

888
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:18,720
From the cradle to the grave,

889
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:21,199
we've never let them live their own lives,

890
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:23,199
and now we're even taking their lives.

891
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:25,800
How could you do this to him?

892
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:37,479
I'm begging you.
Please give Gla's life back to me.

893
01:23:57,079 --> 01:23:58,600
-Blood pressure drop.
-How much?

894
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:00,479
Fifty over seventy, Doctor.

895
01:24:01,319 --> 01:24:03,199
Prep one unit of blood, stat.

896
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:26,800
Attention.

897
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,039
The following flight has been suspended…

898
01:24:29,119 --> 01:24:30,079
Start CPR.

899
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,119
-Now!
-Yes, Doctor.

900
01:24:36,039 --> 01:24:38,279
-Any increase?
-Heart rate dropping.

901
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:22,680
Khim, what's wrong?

902
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:31,840
Gla!

903
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:33,479
Don't die!

904
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:01,319
I gotta go.

905
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,000
Gla!

906
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:09,760
Gla!

907
01:26:10,359 --> 01:26:11,279
Stay strong!

908
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,319
Don't die, Gla!

909
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,319
I won't stop loving you.

910
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:31,880
If I stopped loving you,

911
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,199
it'd be because I'd died.

912
01:26:39,239 --> 01:26:40,680
Gla!

913
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:24,039
Khim, what's wrong?

914
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:45,239
Because love is fragile…

915
01:27:48,439 --> 01:27:51,119
only love can heal love.

916
01:27:56,319 --> 01:27:58,239
When we have to say goodbye…

917
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:24,439
You can only hope that…

918
01:28:25,399 --> 01:28:27,159
we'll still dare to love again.

919
01:28:40,199 --> 01:28:41,159
Hey, Tan.

920
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:44,560
Dry your hair first, oppa,
then dry yourself all over.

921
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:48,560
He's in the past now.

922
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,520
Even if he had lived,

923
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,359
you're way out of his league.

924
01:28:52,439 --> 01:28:53,640
Anyway, now,

925
01:28:54,279 --> 01:28:56,720
you're in a serious relationship.

926
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,119
Marry me.

927
01:29:02,079 --> 01:29:04,079
Do you know someone in heaven, miss?

928
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:05,960
You can send them a letter.

929
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:08,560
I don't know if he's still up there.

930
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:10,079
It's been seven years.

931
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:13,119
Miss Khim hasn't called yet.
She must be on the island.

932
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:15,079
Why did you let her go alone?

933
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:20,119
I'll follow you there.

934
01:29:51,159 --> 01:29:56,119
