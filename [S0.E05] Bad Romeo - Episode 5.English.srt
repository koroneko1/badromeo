FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY

2
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,120
I'll have my baby.

3
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:47,960
After the birth,

4
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,159
I'll give him sole custody.

5
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,840
With a daughter this stupid,

6
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,240
I wouldn't mind being childless.

7
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,039
You see what happens
when you let emotions run your life?

8
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,039
You wanted to care for the baby,

9
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,240
but you didn't help her,
and now she's alone.

10
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,800
My son wants to marry Saikhim.

11
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,560
You think your son is a match
for my daughter?

12
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:08,520
From now on,
no matter what happens in her life,

13
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:11,639
I will make her proud of herself again.

14
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:15,280
Then, at least,
they'll be better parents than you.

15
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,240
I can't imagine waking up
without her there with me.

16
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,800
We've made happy memories so easily.

17
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,479
They'd be hard to come by
if she ever left.

18
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,360
I've held his hand

19
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,879
and sat in his lap.

20
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,439
How will I ever hold anyone else
without thinking of him?

21
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,280
The sunset view
from this house will be so pretty.

22
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,199
All right, let's put a big window here
so we can enjoy the view every day.

23
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,800
What's this house being built for?

24
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,800
It'll be our marital home.

25
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,680
Since we'll be living together,
I want to finish building it very soon.

26
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
I can't wait.

27
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,599
Wait a second.

28
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,319
I never said I'd marry you.

29
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,800
What? Then how would we live together?

30
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,920
Just like we do now, of course.

31
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,439
No, we have to move in together
as soon as the house is ready.

32
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,519
I'm not ready yet.

33
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,120
Can't we wait?

34
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,199
Are you backing out?
We're a family. We should live together.

35
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,079
We'll be the parents of our child,
but we don't have to be married.

36
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,360
No way. Who does that?

37
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,800
You don't want to marry me?

38
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,279
Don't people who get married

39
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,639
love each other?

40
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,160
But… we…

41
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,120
It's too soon to get married.

42
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,160
No, it's not. We're pregnant!

43
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,639
It's actually too late!

44
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,360
Don't you like the food?

45
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,759
I do like it.

46
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,240
Gloy!

47
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,639
Make something different tomorrow.

48
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,480
-All right.
-Good.

49
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,839
Don't worry about it.

50
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,000
Don't people who get married
love each other?

51
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,800
But… we…

52
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,680
we…

53
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,920
It's too soon to just move in together.

54
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,639
What's wrong with them?
They seem so agitated.

55
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
It's your fault.

56
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,560
You keep getting in the way.

57
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,279
They're trying to be intimate,
but they can't.

58
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
We're the third wheel.

59
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,800
Yeah.

60
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,279
Dad?

61
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,360
What's this?

62
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,319
It's mosquito repellent.

63
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,920
Take it to your girlfriend.

64
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,720
Stay with her all night.

65
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,680
No one will interrupt.

66
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,480
All right, Dad.

67
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,839
Wait, Gla.

68
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,879
Put this top on.

69
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,279
It's cold tonight.

70
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,600
There. Go on.

71
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,560
Good night, Dad.

72
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,199
Stay all night, okay?

73
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:38,399
LOVE

74
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,840
Gloyjai bought this at the market.

75
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,360
I didn't know you had one.

76
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,200
Dad gave us orange peels
to keep mosquitoes out.

77
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,519
-Are you okay?
-Just stop.

78
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,320
Light it yourself.

79
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,159
Hey, what are you doing?

80
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,000
You finish it yourself.

81
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,960
INTERVIEW WITH AN EXECUTIVE

82
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,399
Now I see why you hesitated.

83
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,759
If you don't want to do it,
no one will make you.

84
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,840
INTERVIEW WITH AN EXECUTIVE

85
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,440
What? Why are you back already?

86
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,600
Khim, take a look at this.

87
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,559
More guests are coming Friday,
but we have no rooms left.

88
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:10,480
Look at this.

89
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,799
Dad asked me to ask you

90
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:17,600
when you'll move into the new house
so that guests can stay here.

91
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,759
I'll start moving my stuff.
I'll try and get it done by Friday.

92
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,440
Okay then.

93
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,120
The house is so pretty.

94
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:42,960
Pretty enough to live in?

95
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,159
I'm about to move my stuff here.

96
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,919
You said you didn't want to.

97
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,840
Well, the guesthouses are full,

98
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,320
so I had to move out of mine.

99
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,960
Do what you like.
I don't care if you move in.

100
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,840
You might feel weird sleeping alone.

101
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:11,039
You said this would be our marital home.

102
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,639
When I go somewhere I like,

103
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,720
I try to capture the atmosphere
in a sketch in this book.

104
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,679
This book is like a book
of all my happy thoughts.

105
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,000
All the things I love

106
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:14,000
are in here.

107
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,200
Don't people who get married
love each other?

108
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,679
But… we…

109
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:31,080
It's too soon to just move in together.

110
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,360
So this is the real reason.

111
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,159
Auntie Oon.

112
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:25,120
Auntie Oon!

113
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,279
-Hello.
-My goodness! Hello, my dear.

114
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,639
I've missed you so much.

115
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,799
Auntie Oon, did Dad really fire you?

116
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,840
Yes, of course.

117
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,399
It's my fault.
I didn't take good care of you.

118
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,440
That's not true.

119
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,039
I'm sorry, Auntie Oon.

120
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,799
You've worked for our family for decades.
Now you're struggling because of me.

121
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,759
It's all right.

122
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,440
Anyway, how have you been?
Have you been doing well?

123
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,720
At first, I needed time to adjust.

124
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,279
But now,

125
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,799
I like it here.

126
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,799
All right, anyway,

127
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,079
I'll take you to our plantation.
Then you'll see what my life is like.

128
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,599
-Okay.
-All right?

129
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,519
Shall we go now?

130
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,480
My car is over there.

131
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,079
Auntie Oon, you remember Gla, right?

132
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,440
Right.

133
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,319
Hello.

134
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,480
I've prepared your accommodation.
Please make yourself at home.

135
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,319
-All right.
-Let's go.

136
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,359
Don't worry. I'll take that for you.
You must be so tired.

137
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,000
Come on. Let's go home.

138
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:52,920
Can we run an errand here?

139
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,039
What errand?

140
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,200
Now that Auntie Oon is here,

141
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,880
I'd like to take the opportunity
to do the right thing properly.

142
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,160
I wanna get a marriage certificate.

143
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,200
Auntie Oon, you're like Khim's other mom,

144
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,640
so I would like you

145
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,279
to witness our happy occasion.

146
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,400
I was wrong to have been so careless
that I made you feel taken for granted.

147
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:23,079
I understand why you've been
reluctant to marry me.

148
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,640
We've made lots of mistakes.

149
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,359
This is the first time

150
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,960
we'll do everything right,
like other couples do.

151
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,799
Let's not say, "love,"

152
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:43,000
because all this time,
I've been ruled by emotions, not reason.

153
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,079
But now,

154
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:47,319
I'll try living mindfully.

155
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,400
Marry me, Khim.

156
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:59,359
I won't make you regret

157
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,640
giving up your future
to be with someone like me.

158
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,079
Today is the first day

159
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,200
of the rest of your lives
as lawfully wedded husband and wife.

160
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:43,079
I wish everlasting happiness for you both.

161
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:50,279
From now on,
there'll be no Saikhim Kidakarn.

162
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:53,640
There'll be only Saikhim Chayodom.
And she's mine alone.

163
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,599
May you be connected
like a column and a beam

164
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,319
that bear the weight of a whole house.

165
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:15,960
Life can be tough sometimes.

166
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:17,599
If you forgive each other,

167
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,119
you'll be stronger together.

168
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:28,920
Here you go.

169
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,039
Please love and take very good care
of Miss Khim for me.

170
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,319
May you love and stay loyal
to each other for a long time.

171
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,039
Make your house a home,
and everything will be all right.

172
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:00,680
Here you go, Gla.

173
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,680
I'm giving it back.

174
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:05,519
It's the money you've sent home to me

175
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:07,000
since you started working.

176
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:10,480
Keep it.

177
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,559
It's for your family.

178
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,799
No, Dad.

179
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,880
Just take it.

180
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,519
I won't, Dad.

181
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:23,319
If you don't want it,
keep it for my grandchild.

182
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,559
I want you to.

183
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,720
Thank you.

184
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,759
Everyone, shall we take photos?

185
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:42,839
Yeah. Come on.

186
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,079
Let's do this.

187
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,119
How shall we do this?

188
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,599
-Dad, go there.
-Where do I go?

189
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,480
-All right.
-Auntie, go there too.

190
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,400
All right.

191
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,839
Let's go.

192
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,720
Is everyone ready?

193
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:27,200
Uncle Seen doesn't seem bothered
that his daughter ran away.

194
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,119
I think he's trying to get over it.

195
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,160
He's lost face,

196
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,680
but he can't let anyone see that.

197
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,799
That's why he has to keep busy with work.
He's avoiding thinking about his problems.

198
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,119
Do you like it here?

199
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:49,799
It's much nicer than I imagined.

200
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,240
Really?

201
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,759
In that case,

202
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:55,000
come and live with me.

203
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,680
You could raise my baby
like you raised me.

204
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,640
Isn't it too soon?

205
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,079
You've known him a couple of months
and now you're married.

206
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,039
Do you know him well enough?

207
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,160
I haven't known him for long,

208
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:19,200
but he knows me even better
than people I've known all my life.

209
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,720
He might seem a bit too direct,

210
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:24,440
but he never leaves my side
when I'm in trouble.

211
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,799
He takes care of me like I'm a princess.

212
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,119
But I won't tell him that,
or he'll be so smug.

213
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:37,960
Auntie and Khim,
you can stay at our house.

214
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:40,880
Oh dear. Am I inconveniencing you?

215
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,079
Not at all, Auntie Oon.

216
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,359
Tonight, you can stay with me.

217
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,440
Please go ahead. You can have our room.

218
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,359
Oh dear. What about the bedding ceremony?

219
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:57,960
We're not standing on ceremony.

220
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,039
We're not superstitious.

221
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:02,640
It doesn't matter where we sleep.

222
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,240
Then I'll put your bag
in our room, Auntie Oon?

223
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:07,039
That won't be necessary.

224
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,960
I'll do it myself.

225
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,400
No, don't, Auntie Oon.

226
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,559
Stay with me tonight
so that we can stay up and chat.

227
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,720
All right. I'll take your stuff there.

228
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,400
You don't have to.

229
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:25,920
I'll leave you to it.

230
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,559
Auntie Oon…

231
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,279
Hey, should we offer a course

232
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,559
on how to spin cotton thread for weaving?

233
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,319
It might draw more female guests.
Gloyjai could teach them.

234
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,519
Should we try offering this course?

235
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:06,920
Look.

236
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,440
We have to follow the Middle Way

237
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:15,079
and not do too much or too little.

238
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:20,799
Stop talking about work.

239
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,519
Come and take a rest.

240
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,160
Can you stop acting weird?

241
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:17,119
I'm not.

242
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,039
This is what I'm like.

243
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,279
Sure, this is natural.

244
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,160
You're as stiff as a mummy.

245
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,759
If you're not already dead,

246
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:49,400
I guess you're not interested.

247
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,720
Good night. I'm sleepy now.

248
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,799
See if you can fall asleep.

249
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,480
What's wrong?

250
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,000
-Nothing.
-Nothing?

251
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,039
Nothing.

252
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,440
What's wrong?

253
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:47,599
I had sleep paralysis all night. It hurts.

254
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:53,680
Last night, I went to sleep
on top of your arm.

255
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:55,480
Are you okay?

256
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,480
I'll massage you.

257
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:02,880
Feel better?

258
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:10,720
What are you doing?

259
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:11,799
Kissing practice.

260
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,200
You'll feel less awkward,
or you'll get punished.

261
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,359
Stop it.

262
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,000
Stop it. I haven't brushed my teeth.

263
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,039
Really? Now we're under the covers too?

264
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:36,079
I haven't brushed mine either. Come on.

265
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:26,960
Look. It's the Way of the White Elephants.

266
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,800
It's only visible a few months a year.

267
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,440
It also depends on the lunar cycle.

268
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,719
In English, it's called
the "Mill Key Way" or something.

269
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:42,400
Pretty, isn't it?

270
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:47,280
Around here, this is the nightlife.

271
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,000
Do you have to leave so soon?
I wish you'd stay longer.

272
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,519
I have to visit my family.

273
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,960
In that case,
I'll come and visit you there.

274
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,199
Please look after yourself, Miss Khim.

275
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,960
That will be my job.

276
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,880
I'll look after her.

277
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,480
Stay in touch with me.
Don't just disappear.

278
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:57,280
I'll call you every day, Auntie Oon.

279
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,039
Have a safe journey.

280
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:07,960
I will.

281
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:10,360
I'll take my bag.

282
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,360
Allow me.

283
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,280
All right.

284
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,679
I can take it from here.

285
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,920
-It's all right.
-Sure.

286
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,119
-Thank you.
-Ma'am.

287
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,280
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

288
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,280
Don't wait for me. I'll be all right.

289
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:37,519
Let's go.

290
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,079
Hello, dear. Take this.

291
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:00,000
Come on, ma'am.

292
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:11,679
THE WELL-BEING SCHOOL

293
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,679
Gla.

294
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,159
You have a visitor.

295
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,480
Khem! What are you doing here?

296
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:28,320
Gla! Bro, I've missed you so damn much.

297
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:31,360
I came to congratulate you.

298
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,119
You eloped and disappeared on me.

299
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:40,920
This is Khem.

300
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,119
He works at my garage.

301
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,480
He catfished you with my photo.

302
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:45,559
Hold on.

303
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:49,440
Without me, you two would not be together.

304
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,679
You came here just to be snarky?

305
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,960
Actually, there's more to it.

306
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,800
I'm thirsty.

307
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:01,880
Can I have some water?

308
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:15,360
What's wrong?

309
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:20,400
The cops froze the garage's account.
We might not make it out of this mess.

310
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,840
So I brought this.

311
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,400
VEHICLE REGISTRATION

312
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,760
What now, bro?

313
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,079
It's too late to get the money out.

314
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:37,320
Leave the stuff here. I'll deal with it.

315
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,239
Go and lie low a while.
Don't let the cops find you.

316
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,280
The garage is closed, and I have no money.

317
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:47,119
Where can I go?

318
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,119
What's wrong?

319
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,039
He's just visiting us.

320
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,559
Are you sure?

321
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:19,559
What else don't I know about you?

322
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:22,440
What exactly do you guys do at work?

323
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,400
VEHICLE REGISTRATION

324
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,360
We put license plates on tax-dodging cars.

325
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,519
We've been hiding this evidence.

326
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:48,440
I have no degree and no expertise.

327
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,119
I can't make a good living
with a legit business,

328
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,239
so I prey on rich kids
who import cars illegally.

329
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,039
When your cousin got into trouble,
that was because of me.

330
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:02,360
So that's how you earn
the money that you send home each month?

331
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,639
The garage has been shut down,
and the cops are searching it.

332
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:08,519
Khem and I can't go back.

333
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:12,119
You did it because you had no choice.

334
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,239
We don't have the same opportunities,
nor do we have the same needs.

335
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,320
Now that I know this, what should I do?

336
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,079
Do I have to be able to accept this too?

337
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,159
I know I did bad things.

338
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,400
But we can't change our past.

339
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,079
I wish I was born worthy of you,

340
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,400
but I can't change that.

341
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,039
I promise to change my ways.

342
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,800
You don't have to forgive me.

343
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,440
But can you give me
a chance to prove myself?

344
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,960
I promise I won't make you regret
choosing to be with me.

345
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,320
Then just try harder
to think of the baby from now on.

346
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,719
I promise.

347
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:25,719
I won't do business illegally again.

348
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,199
Take my car.

349
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,760
You can keep it or sell it if you want.

350
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:40,880
Think of it as your share of our garage.

351
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:43,159
As for the money that was seized,

352
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:44,760
we traded it for our future.

353
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,440
What about you?

354
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:54,480
I guess I'll start over.

355
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,440
I can't take risks like I used to.

356
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:00,000
I understand.

357
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:02,920
We've been through a lot.

358
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,880
I know you're happy,

359
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,719
and it makes me happy too.

360
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,679
Look after my bro.

361
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,880
Where's Gla, honey?

362
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,400
He didn't milk the cows.

363
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,800
Right. He went to see off his friend.

364
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:23,639
Where the hell to?

365
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,360
By the way,
Gla said he'd visit the bank first.

366
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:34,400
Honey, go and check something.

367
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,639
Is his passbook missing?

368
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,960
All right.

369
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,639
Well, honey?

370
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:02,559
The passbook's missing.

371
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:04,320
Gla must have taken it.

372
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,320
Did he take it, or was it his friend?

373
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:10,920
I knew it.
This colleague of Gla's seems suspicious.

374
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:13,920
Wait. Dad!

375
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,239
What?

376
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:27,159
Hey, Gla!

377
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,119
What are you doing here?

378
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:49,119
You closed it?

379
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:50,360
Where's the money?

380
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,960
I gave it to Khem for his own garage--

381
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,679
And how will your family survive?

382
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,599
How?

383
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,320
Do you plan
to leech off your wife forever?

384
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:11,880
I never thought you'd prioritize
someone else over your family!

385
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,119
Are you angry?

386
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:02,800
Well, shouldn't I be?

387
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:17,920
I didn't give all the money to Khem
for no good reason.

388
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,960
Khem has to look after his mom.

389
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:30,559
Giving him the money

390
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:33,679
when he has to hide from the cops

391
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,480
is the least I can do.

392
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,000
And what about us?

393
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:41,039
We still have our house and our work.

394
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,360
I gave him all the money

395
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,320
'cause I got a power plant surveying gig.

396
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,559
I'll cross the border with the engineers
to the forests of Laos.

397
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,960
I want to make all that money back
before our baby is born.

398
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:02,960
To make all that money,
how many trips would you need to take?

399
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:04,800
How long would it take?

400
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,000
I'll be right back.

401
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:08,559
Then I'll go again.

402
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,440
By the time the baby's due,

403
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,679
I'll have done three or four trips.

404
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:16,039
So that means…

405
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:20,239
we'll be apart from now on, right?

406
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:30,599
I wanna lead our family.

407
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,159
I want our child to be proud of me.

408
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:38,639
So when are you leaving?

409
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,679
Next week.

410
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,239
Wait for me here.

411
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,400
I'll be right back.

412
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,960
I'm a new man now.

413
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,000
You should be happy.

414
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:08,519
That bastard I used to be

415
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:12,679
never even gave you a ring.

416
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:17,679
Don't mourn him.

417
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:27,119
Good men

418
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,800
are harder to find than rings.

419
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:33,239
If I can have a good husband,

420
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:37,280
I don't want a ring.

421
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,000
He fooled her
into signing a marriage certificate.

422
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:28,519
He wants to hit the jackpot.

423
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,440
Miss Khim seems to be infatuated with him.

424
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:36,039
I don't think she realizes
how he's manipulating her.

425
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:39,440
He's using the law as a tool.

426
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:41,440
He's so devious.

427
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,199
Miss Khim probably just wants to be loved.

428
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,159
When someone treats her very nicely,

429
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:48,880
they take advantage of her easily.

430
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,519
Goodness only knows
when Miss Khim will come to her senses.

431
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:54,800
Maybe when I'm dead.

432
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,039
She can forget it.

433
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:58,000
She won't inherit a single baht.

434
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:09,159
Mom, why is Auntie Oon back?

435
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,239
I heard that Seen had her brought back.

436
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,880
But Khim isn't here.
Why bring Auntie Oon back?

437
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:18,639
Maybe Saikhim will be back soon.

438
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:20,800
I heard that her partner

439
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,000
is wanted by the police.

440
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,039
If she's desperate,

441
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:25,599
she'll come home with her baby.

442
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:26,599
Come on.

443
00:50:26,679 --> 00:50:30,199
She's caused such a scandal.
Uncle Seen wouldn't welcome that baby.

444
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,800
Even without Saikhim here,

445
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:34,440
Seen would never care about us anyway.

446
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:38,480
But what if we changed our strategy
and brought Khim back for him?

447
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:41,599
Then would Seen appreciate us?

448
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:42,559
Mom!

449
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,559
I'm sick and tired
of being compared to her all my life.

450
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:47,039
Why would you bring her back?

451
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,119
So that you can take your revenge.

452
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:52,079
That delinquent's time has come.

453
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:54,760
She deserves to be mocked
and shamed by you.

454
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:57,519
I think Seen

455
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:58,960
loves to win.

456
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:01,960
If we can put Khim back in her cage,

457
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,679
we might be able to win back his favor.

458
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,760
That should be easy.
Let's put her husband in jail.

459
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,159
She won't stand a chance.

460
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:11,400
Should we try it?

461
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,800
Maybe your uncle will reward us
with something nice in return.

462
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,320
Khim?

463
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:30,480
Khim.

464
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:33,000
Are you okay?

465
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,400
Medicine must be taken
with caution during pregnancy.

466
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,679
Instead, try this
lemongrass and ginger tea.

467
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:44,840
Does it help treat the common cold?

468
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,599
See if it works.

469
00:51:56,679 --> 00:51:57,960
If it does, I'll brew more.

470
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:10,880
I set up a Wi-Fi router
at Dad's house for you.

471
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,920
By the way,

472
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,559
I'll leave the flashlight
and batteries there…

473
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:25,719
so when it rains and the power goes out,
you can find your way to the bathroom.

474
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:29,199
I heard that pregnancy makes you
go to the bathroom often.

475
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,239
Now we're prepared.

476
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,480
And I almost forgot.

477
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:38,760
Morning sickness is worse
if you wake up hungry.

478
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:43,119
From now on, when you wake up,
eat some of these snacks right away.

479
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:45,559
Don't get up before that, okay?

480
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,320
I've stocked up for you.

481
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:52,320
They're in this bag too,

482
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,800
so you can take them anywhere.

483
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,440
Wait.

484
00:53:02,519 --> 00:53:06,400
Hey, how many months will you be working?
You act like you'll be away for years.

485
00:53:12,519 --> 00:53:15,039
You got sick
even when I'm here to take care of you.

486
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,320
What will happen while I'm away?

487
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,280
By the way…

488
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,760
I saved Dad's number
to your emergency speed dial.

489
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,079
If you need anything, call him.

490
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,760
Just press this.

491
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,559
I know you're worried about me.

492
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:38,440
But

493
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:40,719
you don't have to be.

494
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:43,800
Just focus on your work.

495
00:53:46,679 --> 00:53:48,119
I'll be waiting for you.

496
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:50,519
All right.

497
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,199
MOTHERS AND CHILDREN

498
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:40,400
Sorry.

499
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,280
Lita.

500
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:52,280
We need to talk, okay?

501
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,639
The university has received a complaint.

502
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:57,679
It's about your scholarship approval.

503
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,079
Let's go to my office.

504
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,840
We don't have to buy that yet.
It's too soon for that.

505
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,199
Let's buy it in advance.
Who'll take you shopping while I'm away?

506
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:29,519
There's still so much time.
We can come again later.

507
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,000
Don't you like it?

508
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:35,159
It's just too soon for this.

509
00:56:35,239 --> 00:56:38,719
You can just wear it to stop dirty old men
from trying to seduce you.

510
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,679
Whatever. If you like it so much,
you can wear it yourself.

511
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,800
Khim.

512
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,039
Don't you like shopping together?

513
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:50,519
Think of it as our honeymoon.

514
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:53,360
Let's go home.

515
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,760
Gla.

516
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,280
Stay calm.

517
00:57:08,519 --> 00:57:09,360
This way, Khim.

518
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,800
Gla! Don't run away!

519
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,679
Come on.

520
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:28,559
Khim.

521
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,840
This way, Khim.

522
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:34,519
Hurry.

523
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:56,079
Don't be scared. I know my way
round here with my eyes closed.

524
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,400
I didn't bring you here out of fear.

525
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,360
I just don't want him to remember you.

526
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:10,079
I know what it's like to be hated
for something that's not our fault.

527
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,000
We've both been criticized
for things we can never change.

528
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,239
Who'd dare mess with rich people like you?

529
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,960
I've always been taught

530
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:29,159
not just to do well, but to do my best.

531
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,840
When I was the top student in the class,

532
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,519
Dad would ask me
who was the top student in my year.

533
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,119
The price of being Dad's beloved daughter
was being mocked by other kids.

534
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,559
I couldn't make friends with anyone.

535
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:50,599
I was a freak.

536
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:54,000
The more I tried, the worse it got.

537
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:58,920
Here comes the kid with connections.

538
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,840
If she weren't rich,
she couldn't have transferred this term.

539
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,880
I heard her dad's rich.

540
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:07,440
Hey, everyone.

541
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,400
-Donate some--
-Hey.

542
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,679
What's this box for?

543
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,320
Donations for orphans, huh?

544
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,599
Your wristwatch alone

545
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,360
could sponsor a kid easily.

546
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:23,000
-So why would you ask us for donations?
-Yeah.

547
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:25,519
Go ask your dad for donations.

548
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,760
-Go on.
-Go and ask him for money.

549
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,440
If you don't wanna donate, don't.

550
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,360
Can I sit with you?

551
00:59:58,519 --> 01:00:01,559
You're Saikhim, right? I'm Lita.

552
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,960
You know my name?

553
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:04,880
Yeah.

554
01:00:05,559 --> 01:00:09,760
Actually, I'm one of the recipients
of your dad's scholarship.

555
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,440
Why are you sitting with me?

556
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:15,320
Well, I'm like you.
No one likes me either.

557
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,199
One, two, one, two, three,

558
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,519
one, two, one two, one.

559
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:24,599
-Get ready for "Mock the Sky."
-Ready.

560
01:00:24,679 --> 01:00:26,159
Three, four.

561
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:29,360
Look at the bear, such a cute bear

562
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,639
Look at the bear

563
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:32,000
It's such a big bear

564
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:33,519
Look at it waddling

565
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:34,639
Lala lalala

566
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:35,679
Talala

567
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:40,079
What the hell is this?

568
01:00:41,639 --> 01:00:44,480
Well, you guys think of me as a clown.

569
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:46,519
Here I am, clowning for you.

570
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:48,000
Don't you like it?

571
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,400
You're so fake.
You've always been phony, Saikhim.

572
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,719
Hey, Miss Rich Girl.

573
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,840
-What are you doing?
-Show us your dance again.

574
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,840
You're not as pure
as you want other people to think.

575
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,280
Hey. Wait.

576
01:01:42,039 --> 01:01:45,960
I think Miss Rich Girl
isn't dressed properly.

577
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:48,039
Sort it out.

578
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:50,599
Sure. It's my specialty.

579
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,519
-Come here.
-What are you doing?

580
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:55,320
-Stay still.
-Let go of me!

581
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,239
-Take it off.
-What are you guys doing?

582
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,400
Hey, that looks good.

583
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,679
Take lots of photos.

584
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:01,559
Stop it!

585
01:02:01,639 --> 01:02:02,480
Let go!

586
01:02:05,159 --> 01:02:06,920
-You're a bully!
-You're nuts!

587
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,800
You rabid dogs! Stop biting people!

588
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,400
What psychos.

589
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:13,480
Khim…

590
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,760
if they don't like you,
don't make them, but hold your head high.

591
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,039
I asked Dad for advice.

592
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:24,360
He only said

593
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,280
that I should live a life
that others would envy.

594
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:33,039
But in reality,
I don't think anyone envied me.

595
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,119
I think they pitied me.

596
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:38,079
At least, there was one person
who wanted to be my friend.

597
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:39,960
That was Lita.

598
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:48,519
But after everything that's happened,
Lita will probably be cut out of my life.

599
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:50,039
You see?

600
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:54,280
Being me is no better than being you.

601
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,719
You just didn't have friends.
Your life's still much better than mine.

602
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,760
I worked as an usher in this cinema

603
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,679
for years just to watch movies for free.

604
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:10,000
I'm used to the darkness here
because I worked here.

605
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:12,840
This is why I envy you.

606
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,239
You envy my shabby little life?

607
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,039
At least you got to live.

608
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,800
All I ever did was study.

609
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,199
My dad never understood me.

610
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:26,440
You've been much happier than I have.

611
01:03:26,519 --> 01:03:29,000
And now you have to share
your family with me.

612
01:03:30,679 --> 01:03:32,800
I really can't be as optimistic as you.

613
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,840
I wasn't trying to flatter you.

614
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,440
My life has been full of opportunities,

615
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:45,639
but I…

616
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:48,960
don't have inner strength.

617
01:03:50,679 --> 01:03:53,000
You deal with life's ups and downs
better than I do.

618
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:55,280
I don't have that life skill.

619
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:00,159
That makes you
the gift that heaven sent me.

620
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:02,039
Am I a gift or a curse?

621
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,599
You're a reward.

622
01:04:12,039 --> 01:04:16,239
It's because you say these things
that I fell for you ever since that night.

623
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:20,280
Well, it's true.

624
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,559
Deep down, you're a good person.

625
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:25,159
You just don't always show it.

626
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,920
The more you say,
the harder I fall for you.

627
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:34,599
While I'm away,

628
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,559
don't be so cute around anyone else.

629
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,079
If you do, everyone will fall for you too.

630
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:19,199
You're so romantic sometimes.

631
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:32,239
Here's the outfit I wore
at my first piano recital.

632
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:34,760
Look.

633
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:37,480
I got a haircut that day.

634
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,239
That's my usual barbershop.

635
01:05:41,079 --> 01:05:42,360
They're my buddies.

636
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:48,239
That day, I went
to try on that piano recital outfit.

637
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,719
My word.

638
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,320
Very high fashion.

639
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:54,519
It's pretty.

640
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:56,960
Look.

641
01:05:57,639 --> 01:05:59,800
That day, I got a haircut
to go to a party.

642
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:01,960
Check out the fashion.

643
01:06:02,039 --> 01:06:03,639
That was the height of fashion.

644
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,039
I thought I deleted these.

645
01:06:21,559 --> 01:06:24,159
You guys look quite in love.

646
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,239
Now I know I was wrong.

647
01:06:30,679 --> 01:06:33,760
But you used to love her very much.

648
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,400
We all pay for our mistakes.

649
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:48,239
They say

650
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,719
that at first,
men love you 100% and count down,

651
01:06:51,719 --> 01:06:53,599
but women start at zero and count up.

652
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:55,039
I guess it's true.

653
01:06:57,199 --> 01:06:59,119
You used to love her completely.

654
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:02,239
But now you don't at all.

655
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:07,000
As for me, I didn't think I'd like you.

656
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:10,360
But the more we're together,
the more my feelings grow.

657
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:15,960
One day,

658
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,599
you might start loving me less

659
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:22,280
like you did with others, right?

660
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:23,800
Who said that?

661
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,559
I'll never love you less.

662
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:28,199
I'll only love you more every day.

663
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,440
What if you stopped loving me?

664
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,840
What would happen?

665
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,239
I won't stop loving you.

666
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:37,559
How can you be sure?

667
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:45,159
When I'm with you, my heart beats harder.

668
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:47,920
If I got tired of you,

669
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,519
it'd be when you stopped
making my heart beat.

670
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,039
If I stopped loving you,

671
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:55,679
it'd be because I'd died.

672
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,440
I'm not in a hurry to die.

673
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,280
I wanna love you forever.

674
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,239
Don't flatter me.

675
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,159
What?

676
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:15,760
Wait. Let's take some photos.

677
01:08:17,239 --> 01:08:19,279
Let's not. Why should we?

678
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:21,920
Come on. I'll look at them while I'm away.

679
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,359
One. Two.

680
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:25,720
Three.

681
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:32,760
Use your phone too.

682
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,960
-No, one phone is enough.
-Give me that.

683
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:40,000
I'll count to three, then you kiss me.

684
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:41,760
One. Two.

685
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:44,920
Three.

686
01:08:57,119 --> 01:08:59,600
I hacked Miss Khim's phone
and found this photo.

687
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:28,720
Take care of it.

688
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:30,319
Yes, sir.

689
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:34,920
Uncle.

690
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:38,399
Have you heard about your son-in-law?

691
01:09:39,319 --> 01:09:40,239
What did you say?

692
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,640
I'm sorry.

693
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,640
I meant the man Saikhim is with.

694
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,520
His garage customizes tax-dodging cars,
so it's being raided.

695
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,600
If he's arrested,

696
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,199
Saikhim has nowhere to go.

697
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,800
Do you want me

698
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,279
to bring her back?

699
01:10:02,359 --> 01:10:03,880
I worry that if he's arrested,

700
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,720
he'll involve us to save himself,

701
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,439
and he'll take us down with him.

702
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:11,319
Please let me handle it.

703
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:15,399
Maybe we'll finally get him
out of Saikhim's life.

704
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,039
-Khim?
-Yes?

705
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,840
Gla!

706
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:47,960
Take good care of yourself.

707
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,079
If you can't reach me, don't panic.

708
01:11:54,359 --> 01:11:57,079
The phone signal might be bad
in the forests.

709
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,079
Dad, look after her and the kid.

710
01:12:11,439 --> 01:12:12,279
Work hard.

711
01:12:13,359 --> 01:12:14,800
Don't worry too much.

712
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:25,279
Gla! Get in the van.

713
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:29,319
We should go.

714
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:47,600
I'll be right back when work is finished.

715
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:21,760
Start the van.

716
01:15:48,439 --> 01:15:49,840
What? You're not asleep yet?

717
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:59,439
We checked for signal already.

718
01:16:19,039 --> 01:16:20,439
One. Two.

719
01:16:21,079 --> 01:16:21,920
Three.

720
01:16:54,039 --> 01:16:55,319
Hello, ma'am.

721
01:16:55,399 --> 01:16:56,239
Hi.

722
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,600
Are you visiting our school?

723
01:17:05,319 --> 01:17:09,239
I just came to check out some land.
I was passing through, so I stopped by.

724
01:17:09,319 --> 01:17:11,439
Then please come in.

725
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:13,760
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

726
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:19,439
Our school is a training center
that teaches self-reliance.

727
01:17:20,039 --> 01:17:21,159
Please take a look.

728
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:22,479
I'll show you around.

729
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:24,840
This way.

730
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,760
THE WELL-BEING SCHOOL

731
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:32,720
This way.

732
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,039
We try to make everything ourselves here.

733
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,880
All the Four Requisites,

734
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,560
food, shelter, medicine, and clothing,

735
01:17:46,119 --> 01:17:47,520
we make them all ourselves.

736
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,960
Just like all this cotton.

737
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,680
We're going to weave it
into clothes to wear.

738
01:17:56,199 --> 01:17:57,199
Hello, ma'am.

739
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:21,119
That's my husband's family.

740
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:23,600
I moved here to join him and his family.

741
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:27,119
And how far along are you, sweetie?

742
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,159
Over three months.

743
01:18:32,079 --> 01:18:35,039
You don't look Thai,
but you speak Thai very well.

744
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:41,760
My husband has a business here.
I often fly over here, so I'm used to it.

745
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:42,680
Right.

746
01:18:43,479 --> 01:18:44,439
-Khim?
-Yeah?

747
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:48,359
Let's invite her to stay tonight.
You're welcome to stay, ma'am.

748
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:55,399
This is a community where people exchange
their thoughts on lifestyles.

749
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:00,520
If you like it here,

750
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:02,760
stay as long as you like.

751
01:19:07,399 --> 01:19:09,760
Hey, where's your husband?

752
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:14,000
He crossed the border to work in Laos.
He hasn't come home yet.

753
01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:15,600
Being alone doesn't scare you?

754
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:23,079
When you know how to live with nature,
you have nothing to be scared of.

755
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:29,479
And would you like to have
a son or a daughter?

756
01:19:30,359 --> 01:19:32,199
I'd like to have a son

757
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:34,439
because I want him to be like his dad.

758
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,359
How about you? Do you have kids?

759
01:19:46,039 --> 01:19:47,119
I have a son.

760
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,560
But he's nothing like me.

761
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:57,720
Ms. Asia has a son, but he lives abroad.

762
01:19:58,560 --> 01:19:59,760
Really?

763
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,800
How old is your son?

764
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,079
I suppose he's younger than my son.

765
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,159
I'd say they're the same age.

766
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:13,640
My son is quite immature.

767
01:20:14,279 --> 01:20:17,520
He's just started to grow up
now that he's about to become a dad.

768
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,279
Your mom is so beautiful.

769
01:20:31,279 --> 01:20:32,119
Thank you.

770
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:36,760
She passed years ago.

771
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,560
She never saw her kids' success.

772
01:20:49,239 --> 01:20:51,680
GAOGLA

773
01:20:55,319 --> 01:20:56,359
Please excuse me.

774
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:05,680
Dad, that must be Gla.
Khim is smiling from ear to ear.

775
01:21:08,039 --> 01:21:08,880
Good.

776
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:16,720
Khim, I walked all the way
to the source of the water today.

777
01:21:17,359 --> 01:21:19,960
They mentioned building
a tunnel to divert the river.

778
01:21:20,039 --> 01:21:23,640
It sounds like a difficult job.
This afternoon, the van broke down.

779
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:26,039
When they heard I can fix cars,

780
01:21:26,119 --> 01:21:27,319
they were so impressed.

781
01:21:28,039 --> 01:21:30,479
My boss wants me
to supervise the machinery next time.

782
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,960
My goodness. You're so clever.

783
01:21:35,039 --> 01:21:36,680
And it's only your first trip.

784
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,520
Every time I turn on the lights,

785
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,159
I always think of you.

786
01:21:46,199 --> 01:21:47,920
I think of you every day too.

787
01:21:49,399 --> 01:21:51,560
And when I look at your drawing,

788
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:53,479
I really miss our home.

789
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,479
Be strong for the baby.

790
01:21:59,159 --> 01:22:00,760
It's only your first trip.

791
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:02,720
Hey, Khim.

792
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,119
Can I talk to the baby?

793
01:22:06,199 --> 01:22:07,399
Sure.

794
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,960
Okay, you can talk now.

795
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,079
Hey, kid. This is your dad.

796
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,039
I'm working in the forests.

797
01:22:16,119 --> 01:22:19,039
It's pitch black,
but the sky is full of stars.

798
01:22:23,079 --> 01:22:23,920
Khim?

799
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:28,000
Should we call our baby Temfah?

800
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:31,640
If it's a girl, we could call her Temfah.

801
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:33,800
But if it's a boy,

802
01:22:35,279 --> 01:22:36,680
could we call him Nannam?

803
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,279
Do you think it would like that?

804
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,039
Khim, ask the baby.

805
01:22:41,119 --> 01:22:42,199
Put the phone closer.

806
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,479
Hello? Baby?

807
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:48,560
Put your hand up if your name is Temfah.

808
01:22:49,279 --> 01:22:51,119
No one replied.

809
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:53,760
What? Was there no kicking?

810
01:22:54,359 --> 01:22:55,840
We should pick another name.

811
01:22:57,119 --> 01:22:58,520
Then it must be Nannam.

812
01:22:59,119 --> 01:23:00,880
Nannam, can you hear me, son?

813
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:02,399
Anyone there, Khim?

814
01:23:03,159 --> 01:23:04,399
The baby doesn't like it.

815
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,239
I'll think of other names.

816
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:08,000
How about Tonkhao?

817
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,119
Isn't it cute, Khim?

818
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:12,119
Mommy says no.

819
01:23:12,199 --> 01:23:13,279
You don't like it?

820
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,359
When I'm free, I'll think of more names.

821
01:23:18,439 --> 01:23:21,039
When you get back, we can think together.

822
01:23:23,319 --> 01:23:27,159
THE WELL-BEING SCHOOL

823
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:34,520
Uncle! Are you all right?

824
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:38,960
-I'm fine.
-Oh no. You have a burn blister.

825
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:42,399
Get the gotu kola leaves
that I crushed in the mortar.

826
01:23:42,479 --> 01:23:43,560
-Hurry.
-All right.

827
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:48,439
Come on, honey.

828
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,039
Just put it right there.

829
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:02,319
-Does that help?
-That's better.

830
01:24:03,279 --> 01:24:07,159
I think you should sit down.
I'll clean this up for you.

831
01:24:10,039 --> 01:24:11,439
-Thanks.
-Sure.

832
01:24:16,119 --> 01:24:17,399
I'll clean that up.

833
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:23,680
Gla asked me to look after you,
but in the end,

834
01:24:24,319 --> 01:24:25,680
who's looking after whom?

835
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,680
You raised Gla, and now he's grown-up.

836
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:32,279
Now it's time for us
to repay your kindness.

837
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:39,479
You know, don't you, that Gla

838
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:40,640
isn't my own son?

839
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,560
Gla's real father is a Westerner.

840
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,520
But he doesn't know who it is.

841
01:24:53,039 --> 01:24:54,600
After Gla was born,

842
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:56,960
Rakroy found out

843
01:24:57,479 --> 01:24:58,960
her husband had another kid.

844
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:01,720
The worst part is

845
01:25:02,439 --> 01:25:03,800
she later found out

846
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,479
he wanted to have a second kid

847
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:08,800
so he could give blood
to the first one, who was ill.

848
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,039
Is that really true?

849
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,520
He acted like Gla wasn't human.

850
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:19,920
He saw Gla as a spare part.

851
01:25:20,439 --> 01:25:21,439
So Gla's mom

852
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,000
took him and ran away

853
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,800
to save him from those people.

854
01:25:27,399 --> 01:25:28,680
Later, I married her

855
01:25:29,279 --> 01:25:32,279
and adopted Gla
so they could change their names

856
01:25:32,359 --> 01:25:33,479
and hide from them.

857
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,880
I don't want Gla to get rich or famous,

858
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,920
not because I don't want him to succeed,

859
01:25:42,399 --> 01:25:45,359
but because I want to protect him
from those awful people.

860
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:49,640
Having a child

861
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:50,960
is easy to do.

862
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,399
But keeping a child alive

863
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:55,760
is very hard.

864
01:25:57,279 --> 01:25:58,760
You have to take good care of

865
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:00,560
and support this child well.

866
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:03,479
Make its life in this world worth living.

867
01:26:08,319 --> 01:26:09,920
Gla is so lucky

868
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,119
to have you as a father.

869
01:26:13,279 --> 01:26:14,439
It's absolutely right

870
01:26:15,319 --> 01:26:16,640
that Gla should love

871
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,800
and respect you more than he does anyone.

872
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:30,800
Gla's real father is a Westerner.

873
01:26:31,399 --> 01:26:33,079
But he doesn't know who it is.

874
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,399
After Gla was born,

875
01:26:35,479 --> 01:26:38,760
Rakroy found out
her husband had another kid.

876
01:26:39,279 --> 01:26:42,439
The worst part is she later found out

877
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,279
he wanted to have a second kid

878
01:26:44,359 --> 01:26:47,079
so that he could give blood
to the first one, who was ill.

879
01:26:47,159 --> 01:26:48,279
Hey!

880
01:26:55,439 --> 01:26:56,319
Congratulations.

881
01:26:57,119 --> 01:26:58,239
You survived.

882
01:27:00,039 --> 01:27:02,800
I just want to say
that you owe me your life.

883
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,399
If I hadn't saved you,
you might have died by now.

884
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:09,920
As for the rest of your life,

885
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:11,960
will you give it to me

886
01:27:12,039 --> 01:27:13,399
or to them?

887
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:26,640
Having a child

888
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,640
is easy to do.

889
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:30,720
But keeping a child alive

890
01:27:31,319 --> 01:27:32,199
is very hard.

891
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:38,600
You have to take good care of
and support this child well.

892
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:41,600
Make its life in this world worth living.

893
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:54,439
Are you leaving already?

894
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,359
I have urgent business.
I have to fly home.

895
01:27:57,439 --> 01:27:58,640
Can I help you in any way?

896
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:01,119
No. But thanks.

897
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,159
Do visit us again.

898
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:08,960
By then, you will have had your baby.

899
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,479
Make sure you take good care of it.

900
01:29:10,039 --> 01:29:11,720
We just drive across the border.

901
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:15,560
Once we've delivered the stuff,
we'll get all the money, bro.

902
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:16,479
Take a look.

903
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:17,600
He threatened

904
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:18,720
to make this public.

905
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,039
Your father had a fall.

906
01:29:20,119 --> 01:29:22,760
Won't you go and visit him?

907
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:24,199
Stop! Freeze!

908
01:29:24,279 --> 01:29:25,680
Put the weapon down!

909
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:28,520
Turn, bro!

910
01:29:33,359 --> 01:29:35,039
Officers! My son is there!

911
01:29:38,279 --> 01:29:39,800
We've surrounded the suspects.

912
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:41,000
They won't get away.

913
01:29:41,079 --> 01:29:42,119
We're doomed!

914
01:29:43,399 --> 01:29:44,560
Give yourselves up!

915
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:45,760
A suspect has been shot.

916
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:25,960
