00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,400
THIS FICTIONAL SERIES IS INTENDED
FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY

2
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,039
Why do you look like someone I once knew?

3
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,599
The world isn't that small.

4
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,159
KHEM

5
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,360
It really is him.

6
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,199
The Gla you knew is dead.

7
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,159
I'm not that idiot anymore.

8
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,439
Marry me.

9
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,639
This is Carl.

10
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,960
His name comes from his Thai name, Gaogla.

11
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,479
He changed his whole name.

12
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,039
That's why we couldn't find him.

13
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,199
I told you.

14
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,840
You should have killed me.

15
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,000
This time,

16
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,360
it's my turn.

17
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:17,520
Time doesn't always help us
love each other more.

18
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,479
Instead, time will teach us

19
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,560
that the more we love
and the more we get hurt,

20
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,520
the more love will make us

21
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,240
more wicked than ever.

22
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,120
Did you come back to kill me?

23
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,680
Khim? Are you all right?

24
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,159
Why aren't you asleep yet?

25
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,560
Are you uncomfortable?

26
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,199
It's been a horrible day.

27
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,479
I feel like

28
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,919
I'm in a nightmare.

29
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,840
You should sleep.

30
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,840
Okay?

31
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,919
When you wake up tomorrow,

32
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,479
you'll feel better.

33
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,439
How is she?

34
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,399
Please go ahead.

35
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,560
Are you leaving already?

36
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,439
Thank you for taking the time to see me.

37
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:52,240
Claire, no matter where you are,
think of me, and I'll fly to you.

38
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,920
Who knows when we'll meet again?

39
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,360
I owe you a surprise. Be prepared.

40
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,279
Look after yourself.

41
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,240
I wish we never had to part again.

42
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,360
I have to go now.

43
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:26,720
See you later.

44
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,279
Khim?

45
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,639
Having trouble sleeping?

46
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,120
Let's talk outside.

47
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:22,800
If Khim wakes up and sees this review,
she'll be furious.

48
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,079
The hotel just opened,

49
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,160
and it's already had a break-in.

50
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,600
This news could hurt us.

51
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:32,879
Keep this quiet.

52
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,240
Don't let Khim know.

53
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,759
She needs to get better first.

54
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,759
-Khim…
-We've been libeled.

55
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,519
They said we let an intruder
enter a hotel room.

56
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,600
This is a deliberate attack
on our reputation.

57
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,720
I have to fix this right now.

58
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,600
But Khim…

59
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,199
He's not dead yet?

60
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:07,720
Not only is he still alive,
but he's also a celebrity now.

61
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,279
The media is talking about him
dating a famous model.

62
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,040
How did he get outta hell?

63
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,959
Does Khim know?

64
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,240
She saw him yesterday.

65
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,360
He's become a businessman
named Carl Raman.

66
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,000
Last night's news has brought up his past.

67
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,240
He's the adopted son of the owner
of a major hotel booking site that we use.

68
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:29,000
He's now involved in a start-up.

69
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,720
It's a part of his Minimalist group.

70
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,159
How can this be?

71
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,720
That means his business competes
for profit with our hotels, doesn't it?

72
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,200
He must be leeching off some woman, Uncle.

73
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,480
He came back just to mock us!

74
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,879
He's getting attention as part of
a new generation of entrepreneurs

75
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,200
and is famous for a sharing economy model
designed to create a sharing society.

76
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,559
He lets people trade accommodation,
possessions, and even labor,

77
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,320
disrupting business around the world.

78
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,600
Now he has access to more rooms
than big hotels in our group,

79
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,639
and many countries are banning his app,

80
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,679
so he's forging a path in the ASEAN region
after a big period of growth in China.

81
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,799
He's the representative
that the PM's economic advisory team

82
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,039
is going to sign an MOU with, sir.

83
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,879
If they sign this agreement,

84
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,080
he can officially open
an office in Thailand.

85
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,919
Uncle, don't let him find a way
to compete with us here.

86
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,240
But wasn't that short-term rent
condo project that you wanted to run

87
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,679
in talks with his company?

88
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,879
I didn't know he ran it.

89
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,000
As for Miss Khim's plan
for a six-star island resort,

90
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,679
it will have to wait.

91
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:45,720
How come?

92
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,000
That island is Gaogla's.

93
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,159
What the hell? This is insane!

94
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,360
How did he get so rich?

95
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,840
Just this morning,
he attacked our Hong Kong hotel

96
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,960
on his hotel booking website

97
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,279
by publishing this review.

98
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,360
This can't be a coincidence.

99
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,519
He clearly came back to attack us!

100
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:12,480
Who does that ex-con think he is?
He's too big for his britches!

101
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,759
He thinks he can get
the government to back him?

102
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,120
You should kill his dream now.

103
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,120
He must be so conceited.

104
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,960
He still doesn't know his place
after all this time!

105
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,399
-Thank you for having me. Yep.
-Thank you.

106
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,080
Your review did better than expected.

107
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,039
They've asked us
to delete that post from our site.

108
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,679
They're good at avoiding blame.

109
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,039
They're offering us
a free hotel room anywhere in the world

110
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,639
if we don't talk to the media about this.

111
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,000
What do you think?

112
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,840
If they won't delete the review,
say the incident was a misunderstanding.

113
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,240
Don't let other guests believe them.

114
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:01,360
If you have any updates,
call me right away.

115
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,320
Okay, bye.

116
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,320
Khim?

117
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,440
Look at this.

118
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,879
Why do people care so much?

119
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,000
So who is this man, and where is he from?

120
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:18,600
He's clout chaser
who leeches off famous women,

121
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:21,240
craves the spotlight,
and wants to be noticed.

122
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,679
So are you mad that he stole your thunder
at the hotel opening?

123
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,159
Not at all.

124
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,600
Why would I be jealous of him?

125
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,840
Let's stop thinking of work
and start thinking about our wedding.

126
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:44,879
If Mr. Seen finds out from someone else,
he'll feel like we disrespected him.

127
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,440
Right. Of course.

128
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,080
Miss Khim!

129
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,559
Is it true that Gaogla didn't die?

130
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,639
Auntie Oon!

131
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,120
Yes, Miss?

132
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,399
Sorry, who died?

133
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:01,960
Is Dad home?

134
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,879
I have good news for him.

135
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:06,879
My goodness!

136
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,919
Mr. Tan, you proposed
to Miss Khim already?

137
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,759
Yes, I did.

138
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,799
I'm so happy for you, miss.

139
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,720
Mr. Seen will be so happy for you.

140
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,240
What are you so happy about?

141
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,679
Khim and I got engaged.

142
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,559
So I'd like to see Mr. Seen.

143
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:35,559
How can you celebrate
despite everything that's going on?

144
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,840
Her ex isn't dead yet.

145
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,600
She's replacing him already.

146
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,960
We wanted you to know.

147
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,120
If you're not happy for us,

148
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,080
you can just stand there and be jealous.

149
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:56,039
Come on, Tan.

150
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,960
Let's go.

151
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,679
She hid her ex-lover down a hole,

152
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,240
and he's come back to haunt her,

153
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,120
yet she still dares
to act innocent and deceive Tan, Mom.

154
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,519
Hey, I've got a feeling

155
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,080
that this is a time bomb
waiting to blow up Khim's life.

156
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,159
Please excuse me.

157
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,360
There's trouble at the hotel.

158
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,320
You're so gutsy
to diss them on their own turf.

159
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,639
Well, they invited me to stay.

160
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,000
Maybe they thought
you wouldn't dare take their deal.

161
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,200
There's nothing to fear.

162
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,320
He's really staying at our hotel?

163
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:16,200
Yes, we made a deal
so he'd let go of the Hong Kong incident.

164
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,919
I don't trust him.

165
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,639
Does he have an ulterior motive?

166
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,639
I don't know.

167
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,519
I only know he's staying with us,

168
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,240
and he hasn't said for how long.

169
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,039
If you're worried,

170
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:39,720
I'll have our people watch him.

171
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,200
Don't do that.

172
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,039
He'd criticize us even more
and say we're violating his privacy.

173
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,840
Let's not look for trouble
by waging psychological warfare on him.

174
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,519
For now, let's just make sure
our staff takes the best care of him.

175
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,759
Yes, miss.

176
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,159
Hey, bro!

177
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:11,799
-May I arrange your bags?
-Hey, bro!

178
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,639
It's okay. I can take care of my own boss.
He doesn't like to be disturbed.

179
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,360
If I need anything, I'll ask you.

180
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,559
Okay?

181
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:21,480
Just take care of this. Here you go.

182
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,840
Here.

183
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:27,000
You can just get these washed. Thank you.

184
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,320
We need your ID card.

185
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:33,519
My ID card? What do you need it for?

186
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,519
It's our policy to keep tabs on
whoever visits our guests in their rooms.

187
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,519
I see.

188
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,320
Right. Okay.

189
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:44,200
That shouldn't be a problem.

190
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,080
-Thank you.
-Sure.

191
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:50,080
I'll bring it back.

192
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,000
All right.

193
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:56,320
What a snob!

194
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,600
I told you to change your shoes.

195
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,600
My feet are just feet.
Why should anyone feel bothered by them?

196
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,600
Come here.

197
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,320
Keep this on.

198
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:24,039
The Hoteliers' Association has registered
a complaint with my ministry.

199
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,000
If we let any random person
turn their accommodation into a homestay,

200
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,919
we'll end up with unfair competition.

201
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,399
Yes, I understand.
Hotels have protested before.

202
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,320
ONE HOUR BEFORE

203
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,240
Other countries have banned my company.

204
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,279
Billion-baht investors don't want
random people to compete with them, right?

205
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:48,039
If we let random people without permits
gain direct access to tourists,

206
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:53,000
we can't regulate anything,
and if anything damaging happens,

207
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,120
it will ruin the country's image.

208
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,279
Please excuse me.

209
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,240
Laundry delivery.

210
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:05,599
Come on in.

211
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,039
-Take this. See you tomorrow.
-Thank you.

212
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,720
But the hotel doesn't want me
to come up here.

213
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,680
If they have a problem, they can call me.

214
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:23,599
Yes, sir.

215
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,119
Our service isn't just for renters.
Our app serves surrounding communities.

216
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,200
Every resident can play their part
in welcoming tourists who visit them.

217
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:40,759
Thai people are known
for kindness and friendliness.

218
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:42,039
It's a huge selling point.

219
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,279
I left money here. Look at that.

220
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,519
SIR, YOU FORGOT YOUR CASH

221
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,039
How many other countries could be
as good at hosting as Thailand?

222
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,640
For tourism to grow,
it has to be sustainable like this.

223
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,039
PLEASE MAKE UP ROOM

224
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,400
My goodness! I'm so sorry.

225
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:35,160
Hey. Stop it, please, honey.

226
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:36,880
Stop it, please.

227
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:40,519
Excuse me, ma'am.
Please don't disturb the other guests.

228
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,240
Please wait outside.

229
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,319
-I'm sorry.
-Sure.

230
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:49,960
We have to think carefully again
before signing the MOU

231
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,400
because if we don't,

232
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,559
we'd let those multinational investors
take all the commissions for free

233
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,359
while taking no responsibility.

234
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,599
Excuse me. Mr. Carl is here.

235
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,839
That's good timing.

236
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,240
Welcome, Mr. Carl.

237
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,519
Dad is here, isn't he?

238
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:41,240
Yes, he's meeting the PM's advisor
in the dining room now.

239
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:43,359
Have you brought someone
to Mr. Carl's room?

240
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,000
Did anyone see the guest leave?

241
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:51,599
What's going on?

242
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,960
I asked Mr. Carl to join us
for a straightforward discussion.

243
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,279
I actually like fair competition too.

244
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,799
Amateurs

245
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,400
and professionals

246
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,720
can't compete with each other fairly.

247
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:09,240
They're not comparable.

248
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,480
Nowadays, the safer your investments are,
the riskier they end up being

249
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,279
because the world changes fast.

250
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:19,960
If professionals can't adapt in time,
they'll keep falling behind everyone else.

251
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,839
The service industry

252
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,680
sells satisfaction.

253
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,039
It will never fall behind

254
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,039
as long as it can impress customers.

255
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,720
-What's wrong?
-Yeah, I know, right?

256
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,759
Look at this.

257
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,400
-MAKE UP ROOM
-DO NOT DISTURB

258
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,799
We don't know
if they want the room cleaned or not.

259
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,359
If they want us to clean,
and we don't do it,

260
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,599
will we be in trouble?

261
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
If they want privacy,

262
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,640
and we barge in, we'll be in trouble too.

263
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,839
-Hello?
-Don't go in there. It's a trap.

264
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,680
He's messing with us.

265
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,519
Don't fall for it.

266
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:13,519
He's such an odd person.

267
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:17,440
We found the VIP in the dining room.

268
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,680
The dining room?

269
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,400
Sir, when you last visited,

270
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,880
you said you liked our soup.

271
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,759
The chef made some especially for you
so you can have as much as you like.

272
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:35,920
We always focus on

273
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,160
going above and beyond what's asked of us…

274
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:42,559
because we want every guest
to feel important.

275
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,359
If everyone were equally important,

276
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,240
there wouldn't be double standards.

277
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,000
Working with my database,

278
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,079
I can give them what they want
before they ask.

279
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:02,240
We'd never make our guests
feel uncomfortable

280
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,680
or like they're an inconvenience.

281
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:07,359
I think wherever they are in the world,

282
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,319
they should feel right at home,

283
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,200
then they'll want to visit
again and again.

284
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,279
If we can't even do that,

285
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:17,640
so-called professionalism would be worth
absolutely nothing at all.

286
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:47,440
They said you were dead.

287
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:49,240
I'm too stubborn to die.

288
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,839
So why are you here?

289
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,079
To watch my enemy die.

290
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:17,240
Our past taught me

291
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,480
that people die three times.

292
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,279
The first is during our last breath.

293
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,039
The second is when our body decomposes.

294
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,359
We die the third time

295
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,319
when those we leave behind forget us.

296
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,799
Now I'm back to take your lives too.

297
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:35,359
You'll die on the inside

298
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,519
and live forgettable lives.

299
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:40,759
The world will forget you ever existed.

300
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,519
I'll make you want to stop breathing

301
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:46,359
without asking you to.

302
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,039
What happened?

303
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:01,640
He came back to insult me!

304
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,799
Why did you let him
wander around our hotel?

305
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,480
If no one snuck into
the psycho's hotel room in Hong Kong,

306
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:11,599
he'd have no reason to threaten us.

307
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,839
You're the person in the photos?

308
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,799
I just wanted to find out
how he became this person called Carl.

309
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,319
You weren't trying
to rekindle an old flame?

310
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:30,279
I want nothing more to do with him.

311
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:32,720
Even if you were interested,
would he care about you?

312
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,359
I heard that now,

313
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,559
he's way out of your league, right?

314
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,359
Be mindful of what you say.

315
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,039
But it's true, Uncle.

316
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,759
Carl's girlfriend is a huge star
who's famous all over Asia.

317
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:46,440
She's beautiful, rich, adorable,

318
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:47,920
and she's a nice person.

319
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,079
Dear me, I don't think he'd like
someone like Saikhim anymore.

320
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:56,240
Look, don't let Tanthai find out.

321
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:00,400
If he hears about your past,
maybe there won't be a wedding.

322
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,039
Wedding? What wedding?

323
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,400
Wait. Khim, haven't you told your dad?

324
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,319
Uncle, Tan has finally agreed
to become your son-in-law.

325
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,920
Congratulations, Khim. You did it.

326
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,720
Dad?

327
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:29,519
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about the engagement.

328
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:32,519
It was very sudden.
It caught me off guard.

329
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,519
I'm happy for you, Khim.

330
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,720
You're even more grown-up now.

331
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,319
Tanthai will be
a great supporter of your career.

332
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:43,119
Thanks to him, I felt able
to step back and enter politics instead.

333
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,480
But we're not getting married
just because of that.

334
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,160
We're getting married
because we love each other.

335
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:55,279
Loving each other is good,

336
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:58,920
but it's even better
when you make each other better.

337
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:02,279
We shouldn't stay with someone
who drags us down, okay?

338
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,440
We weren't born
to make the same mistakes over and over.

339
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,839
You almost let Tanthai get away once.

340
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,200
Luckily, you changed your ways in time.

341
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,200
Dad, you sound like you're saying
that I'm not worthy of Tan in some way.

342
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,119
Khim,

343
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,039
you ran off with a man once.

344
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,880
Good men just can't accept that,

345
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,039
so don't ever let him find out.

346
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,920
Not even after the wedding.

347
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,960
Understand?

348
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:37,599
Who would have believed

349
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,519
that such an ugly duckling
could turn into that hot swan?

350
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,640
He might be even richer
than Uncle's future son-in-law.

351
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,200
If he were to become your son-in-law,
what do you think Uncle Seen would say?

352
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:50,799
Goodness! What on earth are you thinking?

353
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,599
Mom, you know Uncle Seen has compared
me to Khim since we were kids.

354
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,759
To him, nothing I do is good enough.

355
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,279
Mr. Seen, did you know that Prim
has just become the fashion director

356
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:03,440
of the magazine, Unique?

357
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:05,720
To be someone's employee,
you must work hard.

358
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,519
If you were half as talented as Khim,
I'd have given you hotel business to do.

359
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,680
But we all know

360
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,039
you're not good at anything.

361
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,319
Do whatever you want,

362
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,720
but make sure
no one talks about you being my niece.

363
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,200
Mom,

364
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,319
if I want to outdo Khim,

365
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,480
I have to find a better husband.

366
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:28,440
And now,

367
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:31,160
the only candidate
better than Tan is Carl.

368
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:32,720
If Khim knew

369
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:37,200
that Carl liked me,
she'd probably die of heartbreak.

370
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,160
Oh dear.

371
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,759
Listen, Uncle Seen won't like that at all.

372
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,720
For now, you're right,
Uncle Seen won't like it.

373
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,279
But in the future,

374
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:49,400
who knows?

375
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:52,519
Mom, think about it.

376
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:54,799
Uncle Seen cares about profit the most.

377
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:57,400
So, one day,

378
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,319
I believe he'll want to gain
money or influence via Carl.

379
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,720
Miss Khim, you asked me to find some info.

380
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,759
Here's what I found. Here you go.

381
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:13,599
Thank you.

382
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:18,839
What's Prom doing?

383
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,680
Getting someone to investigate Gaogla.

384
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:26,640
Prom knows that he's trying to entrap us,
yet he's playing into his hands anyway,

385
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,640
and he's putting our employees at risk.

386
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,039
If he catches us in the act again,
he'll expose us, you know?

387
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,160
The VIP's guest just came down.

388
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,240
The VIP is at the pool now.

389
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,319
That woman is Gaogla's guest.

390
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,599
Since she checked in at our hotel,

391
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,880
she's barely used any of our services.

392
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,880
She just keeps bringing her guests in.

393
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,039
I'll catch up with you.

394
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,799
Miss Saikhim?

395
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,160
It's okay.

396
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,039
What's he doing now?

397
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,799
Gloy.

398
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,440
Is that you, Gloy?

399
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,440
You still remember me.

400
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,680
Are you well, Gloy?

401
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:55,039
Probably not as well as you.

402
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,559
Don't worry.

403
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,279
I'm still around.
I'm destined to live a long life.

404
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,680
I guess you came to see him.

405
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,559
Go ahead.

406
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,160
Congratulations, bride-to-be.

407
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,000
I hope that this time,

408
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:18,279
it'll last longer.

409
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,160
Don't!

410
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,079
Gla!

411
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,960
I don't get why you had to come here.

412
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,519
Wait… did you come to tempt your woman?

413
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,519
My woman?

414
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:17,279
Look at you, wearing next to nothing
and swimming where she could see.

415
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
She came to look at your six-pack.

416
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,480
Is that what you wanted?

417
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,559
Are you satisfied?

418
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,720
Why should I be? Let's go.

419
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,039
Gla, you planning on staying here
for good or something?

420
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:52,720
Are you hungry?

421
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,079
If I were,
would we pick these mushrooms for lunch?

422
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,400
You're always on the move.

423
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,240
Why don't you
find a home somewhere to settle down, huh?

424
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:04,799
You have money

425
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,400
but act like a vagrant.

426
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,880
Having everything doesn't mean
that you must be rich.

427
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,920
Owning stuff doesn't make me happy.

428
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,480
All this stuff isn't
a measure of happiness.

429
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,359
Even our bodies aren't our own.

430
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,799
We're just borrowing them.

431
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:27,160
I've been wondering
when I'll leave this broken body behind.

432
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,960
If it weren't for me,
you wouldn't have been shot that day.

433
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,480
We both got hurt.

434
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,759
I lost my leg. You lost your kidney.

435
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:51,440
We each lost something.

436
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:55,720
I promise you
that someone will lose more than we did.

437
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:04,640
By the way…

438
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,840
I have news
from the bank I was talking to.

439
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,280
Look.

440
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,000
The bank is interested in granting
home and condo loans

441
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,280
for investment purposes

442
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,320
so that borrowers can rent out their homes
on a short-term basis

443
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,559
as a way for young people
to earn extra money.

444
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:30,679
They want to partner with our booking site
and make it part of their services.

445
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,159
You think it's worth it?

446
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,159
I know

447
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,079
that your investment's value

448
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,079
isn't calculated in terms of money.

449
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,719
You already know what you want
in return for your investment,

450
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,519
don't you?

451
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,679
I'm glad we sent you to study abroad.

452
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,519
Make the deal for me.

453
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:49,880
I sure will.

454
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,920
This project's profits will blow
these people's minds.

455
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:10,679
CARL RAMAN, ASIA RAMAN

456
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,400
Gla's real father is a Westerner.

457
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:16,639
But he doesn't know who it is.

458
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,400
After Gla was born,

459
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,719
Rakroy found out

460
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,519
her husband had another kid.

461
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,559
The worst part is she later found out

462
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:29,559
he wanted to have a second kid

463
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:32,079
so that he could give blood
to the first one.

464
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,679
Asia Raman.

465
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,159
I don't want Gla to get rich or famous,

466
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,920
not because I don't want him to succeed,

467
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:55,400
but because I want to protect him
from those awful people.

468
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,440
He's like a different person.

469
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,920
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

470
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,400
Hello, Miss Khim!

471
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,360
What a coincidence.

472
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,599
Carl is staying here. Have you seen him?

473
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,800
No, I haven't.

474
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:49,639
Are you in Bangkok for work?

475
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,199
No, I'm not.

476
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:53,519
I flew here to surprise him

477
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:56,760
to repay him
for flying to surprise me in Hong Kong.

478
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,840
I see.

479
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,039
Excuse me, I have to go prank someone.

480
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:04,159
See you later.

481
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,320
-How are we?
-Gosh!

482
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,519
Is our patient better?

483
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:18,400
Let's see.

484
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,800
I'm better now.

485
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,800
I wanted to bring you a bouquet,
but I was afraid it would make you worse.

486
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,679
Honestly, I'm okay.

487
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,159
Are you sure?

488
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,559
You still need to rest,

489
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:40,159
so I don't want
us to go out unnecessarily.

490
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:41,840
We should go home after dinner.

491
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,079
I've told Dad about our engagement.

492
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,000
Tan, let me know
when you want your family to come over.

493
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:58,480
Khim,

494
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:00,719
I want to marry you soon

495
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,679
so I can get you out of that house
as soon as I possibly can.

496
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:10,480
Since the Hong Kong incident,
I've had to stay on my guard.

497
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:13,719
I never know
when Prom will use it against me.

498
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,559
If I slip up,

499
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:18,079
they're ready to pounce and hurt me more.

500
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,639
I'm sorry,

501
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,480
but I think your dad is to blame for this.

502
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,840
You and your cousins compete
because of him,

503
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,400
so your house is a war zone.

504
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:36,519
But I promise you
that our family will never be like that.

505
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:39,920
Okay.

506
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,880
Let's order.

507
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,039
Khim,

508
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,239
it's that couple.

509
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,000
Miss Khim!

510
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,840
I think we need a change of scenery.

511
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,800
Hey.

512
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,119
Is he staying at your hotel?

513
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,639
Why is he around so much lately?

514
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,559
I don't know if it's a coincidence
or if it's deliberate.

515
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,800
Having fun?

516
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,000
I always have fun when I'm with you.

517
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:05,440
What are you watching?

518
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,159
Right.

519
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,199
-Talk about the app.
-Yes. Please check out the Arsa app.

520
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:14,800
It's a good app,
and it helps lots of people.

521
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,679
They seem down-to-earth.

522
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,039
Plus they're open
and not precious about privacy.

523
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:22,559
I think they make a good couple.

524
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:25,000
Don't forget to download it, everyone.

525
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:27,000
See all their fans?

526
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:28,559
Can you see what's behind us?

527
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:40,000
They don't have to hide
from the paparazzi who stalk them,

528
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,000
unlike other celebs.

529
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:45,119
Stalk them?

530
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,119
What's Prom doing?

531
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:49,119
Getting someone to investigate Gaogla.

532
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,639
I'll be back.

533
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:56,800
Khim!

534
00:40:57,519 --> 00:40:59,679
-When did he leave?
-About half an hour ago.

535
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:07,079
Is this wise, sir?

536
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,000
Open the door!

537
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:12,320
Prom!

538
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:16,119
-What are you doing?
-Finding out what he's planning.

539
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:18,960
Don't get involved. It could be a trap.

540
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:21,199
He wants us to get suspicious

541
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,079
so he can entrap us for snooping.

542
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:25,280
I won't get caught like you, dummy.

543
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,000
Open the door!

544
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,119
Prom!

545
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:31,159
You don't know him like I do.

546
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,519
Why should we be afraid of him?
If he wants a fight, let's give him one!

547
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,559
Prom!

548
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,480
-Well?
-We caught him, bro!

549
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:04,599
We got her cousin this time.

550
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:05,840
Deal with the snoop.

551
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,760
I sure will.

552
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,480
What's wrong?

553
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,000
We have a very important guest.

554
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:53,159
Just my luck.

555
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,800
I have to clean up this mess.

556
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,519
Answer it.

557
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,239
Did he answer?

558
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,480
The phone's ringing. What now, sir?

559
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:09,000
Don't worry. Ignore it.

560
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,400
What a waste of time. We found nothing!

561
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:28,639
Your first mistake was forgivable.

562
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,599
But if you keep making mistakes…

563
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,960
you're a lost cause.

564
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:51,599
I should get that.

565
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,599
Hello.

566
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,599
Thank you.

567
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:03,840
Prom, get out of there now.
Someone's coming upstairs.

568
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,519
You're running a whole operation?

569
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,880
Hey, my boss asked me to tell you

570
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,400
that he's touched by how much you care,

571
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,719
but he asks you to stop harassing him.

572
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,840
This is too threatening.

573
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,880
He won't stand for it.

574
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,960
We're moving out right now.

575
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,000
What are you looking at?

576
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,519
Officers?

577
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,480
Please perform a search.

578
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:07,639
My boss's valuable item is missing.

579
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:09,559
Maybe he took it.

580
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,400
Don't get cocky.

581
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,920
If you don't find anything,

582
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,559
can you pay the price?

583
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,920
Please allow us to search you. Go ahead.

584
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:23,519
-May I?
-Go ahead.

585
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,599
There it is.

586
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,440
They did steal it.

587
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,639
You're trying to frame me?

588
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,000
So you're the larcenist.

589
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:50,760
Teach him a lesson

590
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,280
so that he doesn't do it again.

591
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,159
You are under arrest

592
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:56,280
for breaking and entering and for theft.

593
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,400
You're conspiring to pin charges on me!

594
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,480
Are you getting revenge?

595
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:02,079
Are you?

596
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:07,199
Last time, I went to jail
because of your dirty tricks.

597
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,280
Now we're even.

598
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,119
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

599
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:13,199
Come on, sir.

600
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,320
Scumbag!

601
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,639
-Gla!
-Come on, sir.

602
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:16,760
Go back to hell!

603
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,360
I'll make you pay!

604
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,239
Remember that! Let me go!

605
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:22,400
Dad?

606
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,440
Why was Mr. Chartchai fired?
What did he do wrong?

607
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:29,800
You'd rather have Prom fired
to settle the case?

608
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,079
But Mr. Chartchai followed Prom's orders.

609
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:35,800
He was doing his job.

610
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,159
We're just making him the scapegoat.

611
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:42,960
Do you want to be the scapegoat?
Will you take all the blame?

612
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:45,159
You took in that tramp.

613
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,039
If you never got involved with him,
today wouldn't have happened.

614
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:54,159
We have to clean up after your messes,
and you still haven't learned anything?

615
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,679
If I'd been the one who'd died that day,
everything would be better now, right?

616
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:15,159
Are you still hungry?

617
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:20,079
That sushi looks good. Hey!

618
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,159
Bro.

619
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:30,679
I got him back for you.

620
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,400
Tomorrow, we'll find out how they'll pay.

621
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:37,639
Isolate them so they have no choice
but to attack each other.

622
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:39,079
Yeah.

623
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:44,039
Bro, I found a new place for you to stay

624
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:46,440
in case you need privacy.

625
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:51,280
Listen, the bed is very soft. Enjoy it.

626
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,920
Give me the keys. I'll drive.

627
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,280
Okay. Go and enjoy that bedroom.

628
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:01,960
So he finally signed the agreement.

629
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:05,760
He's clearly announcing himself
as our enemy publicly.

630
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,719
He's expanding his company in Thailand.

631
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,239
He's clearly defying you on purpose!

632
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:13,079
It won't be easy.

633
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,880
Now I know
why he came to stay at our hotel.

634
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,360
Why?

635
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:28,920
He's interested in
the traditional house opposite our hotel.

636
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,159
I saw that his telescope was aimed
at the other side of the road.

637
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:40,599
I looked through the telescope
and saw that it was focused on that house.

638
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:42,840
But at first, I didn't suspect anything.

639
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,599
And then I saw this.

640
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:56,519
He drew the plans for that house on this.

641
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:03,800
He even wrote the phone number.

642
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:07,880
I checked and found
that it's really the number of that house.

643
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:11,440
My theory must be correct.

644
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:13,239
He's interested in that old house!

645
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:16,679
He thinks he's defeated us.

646
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,000
But actually,

647
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,079
this round ended in a draw.

648
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:24,519
That's right, Mom.
Prom, you hit him below the belt so hard.

649
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,039
Actually, we might be jumping
to the wrong conclusion.

650
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,039
It's better than going along with him.

651
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,679
If he really wants this old house,

652
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,719
we'll buy it first.

653
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:42,400
That will teach him.

654
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:45,920
Uncle?

655
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:51,840
We should use it for my condo project.
Do you think that's a good idea?

656
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:55,119
Wait. I'd like to help too.

657
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:58,519
I'll find out
what he wants to use that property for.

658
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,440
I'm good at punching below the belt.

659
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:12,599
We managed to turn the tide our way
because I dared to take a huge risk.

660
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,039
Step aside if you can't handle it

661
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,920
'cause it's a big boy's fight.

662
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:32,800
Lots of people on the Internet are sharing
stories about Carl this morning

663
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:37,320
because last night, Claire livestreamed
while he prepaid for iced black coffees

664
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,239
to treat people
who couldn't afford to buy them.

665
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,440
Then people went to find
the free iced black coffees

666
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:45,519
and bought more for other people too.

667
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:04,360
These two are getting a lot of praise.

668
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,920
They call Gaogla a holy man.

669
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,760
Some call him a clean living guru.

670
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,039
Lots of people have downloaded
his Arsa app already.

671
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,519
That's the boat captain

672
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,239
who picks up passengers behind our hotel.

673
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,639
Last night, Gaogla hired him via the app,

674
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:29,079
so I questioned him.

675
00:53:29,159 --> 00:53:33,480
I found out that Gaogla is using this app
to generate his own hype.

676
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:00,119
Gaogla is making us look like demons

677
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:03,480
while everyone sees him as a holy man.

678
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,400
Gaogla developed the Arsa app
to build a world based on sharing.

679
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,719
It encourages city residents
to be kind to each other

680
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,079
by sharing their possessions

681
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:17,320
or even their time.

682
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:21,719
He has made time more valuable
by having people sacrifice it to do tasks

683
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,760
that others ask them to do,

684
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,599
such as calling cabs,
going shopping, waiting in lines,

685
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:31,159
fixing cars, watching over patients,
and helping with homework

686
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,400
in exchange for labor costs or Arsa points

687
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,559
which can be collected
and used to request help from others.

688
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:50,559
NAME: KASALONG SANGCHAI

689
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,880
HELLO, KASALONG SANGCHAI

690
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:12,199
Attention, please.

691
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,559
This is the final call for flight…

692
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,440
Claire.

693
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,400
Hey! You came to see me off at the lounge?

694
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,119
Hey, you make me wish I weren't leaving.

695
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:35,360
We used every second of our time well.

696
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,239
Take this.

697
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,199
Keep it and think of me.

698
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,000
You've gone nuts.
Who grows mushrooms for their girlfriends?

699
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:53,920
Huh?

700
00:55:54,679 --> 00:55:56,480
Eat them and think of me.

701
00:55:58,039 --> 00:55:59,960
Don't miss me too much. We'll meet soon.

702
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:10,480
While I'm gone, be good. Don't misbehave.

703
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:12,039
All right.

704
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,719
Thank you.

705
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,079
You're the cutest.

706
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:28,320
Hey! I'm so glad to meet you at last.

707
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:32,800
I'm Primprao, Saikhim's cousin.

708
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,760
You nearly became my cousin.

709
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,119
Wait!

710
00:56:37,639 --> 00:56:40,000
I heard that last night,

711
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,920
you got even with my big brother,

712
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:43,960
so today, I've come to

713
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
call a truce.

714
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:47,480
A truce?

715
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:51,719
I know they treated you so badly,
but I'm not like them,

716
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,800
so maybe we could be friends.

717
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,480
I can't fake it.
I'm too lazy to be two-faced.

718
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:00,159
I'm not faking it either.

719
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,519
Everything I say comes from the heart.

720
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:06,719
If you don't believe me,

721
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:09,559
do you want to test me?

722
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,960
If you get lonely or bored, call me.

723
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:39,400
I thought she would never leave.

724
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,719
Look at that pouty face.

725
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:44,360
Do I look stupid enough to fall for that?

726
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,719
Those people must be desperate enough

727
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:49,320
to try that basic move on you.

728
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:57,360
I got a prescription. Take these.

729
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,639
You're doing nightly remote work meetings.

730
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:01,400
Time difference is bad for the body.

731
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,119
Don't live recklessly.

732
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:05,360
Take good care of your body!

733
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:07,400
Are you even listening?

734
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:15,159
You're even prettier in real life.

735
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:18,880
Dad?

736
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,719
Khim and I are getting married.

737
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,639
You know very well

738
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:33,800
that she only sees you as a pile of money,

739
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,719
yet you still let her trap you.

740
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:45,960
Dad, why are you here?

741
00:58:48,679 --> 00:58:50,639
Gaogla has been in the old house a while.

742
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:52,920
He hasn't come out yet.

743
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,559
Our people saw
his assistant waiting outside.

744
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,360
My theory must be correct.

745
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,679
He wants that house.

746
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:02,760
Why should we care?

747
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:06,119
If we keep making a fuss,
we'll always be one step behind him.

748
00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:07,559
We don't have to care.

749
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:09,760
He lives his life. We live ours.

750
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:16,079
What if he opens
a competing hotel opposite ours?

751
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:17,000
What then?

752
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:19,239
Do we let him attack us first?

753
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,679
That's why I suggest
opening a condo first.

754
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,159
I'll do it!

755
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:27,320
You can't just do
that sort of thing so easily.

756
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,920
If you're scared, do nothing.

757
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,679
Let Prom do it.

758
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,400
We don't let spineless people
drag our business down.

759
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:47,360
Wait. Did you forget something?

760
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,920
-Well…
-Please go ahead.

761
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,000
Is her family pushing you
to get married soon?

762
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:58,920
Not at all.

763
00:59:59,719 --> 01:00:01,480
Khim and I made the decision together.

764
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:13,320
Do you know Carl, the startup businessman

765
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,719
who's trending right now?

766
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,360
He has a sister.

767
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,280
I think she's better for you.

768
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,000
It's more like you want me
to leech off a woman.

769
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:25,679
Well, these things should be
win-win situations.

770
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:43,760
What?

771
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:47,239
Where are you going?

772
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:03,159
LITA

773
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,639
What a bunch of nonsense.

774
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,639
Hello. Urgent work?

775
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:20,679
-Hey.
-Okay. Excuse me.

776
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,679
Hey.

777
01:01:38,519 --> 01:01:39,519
Did it go well, bro?

778
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,519
I totally forgot.

779
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:52,480
I prepared two sets like every year.

780
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:54,920
What should we do with the second one

781
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:56,719
since he's still alive?

782
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:01,039
We can't dedicate the blessings to him.
That would be rather strange.

783
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,519
Just give it to the monks.

784
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:08,239
Maybe if we share the blessings,
we'll get even and be rid of each other.

785
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,199
It's tasty, right?

786
01:02:11,719 --> 01:02:14,559
-Yeah.
-I know some other good places to eat too.

787
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,119
I get it, bro. I do.

788
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:19,559
What do you get?

789
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:23,639
When there's something nice to eat,
and you have no one to eat it with,

790
01:02:23,719 --> 01:02:25,679
it's really heart-wrenching.

791
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,840
That's all love is.

792
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,280
Lonely people know this.

793
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
You gotta get through
the loneliness somehow.

794
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:34,840
What's with the drama?

795
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,159
Well, isn't it true?

796
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:40,719
You want to talk to them,
but you don't get to.

797
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,840
I know you don't know who to talk to.

798
01:02:45,719 --> 01:02:47,320
Your girl is never here to talk to.

799
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:51,679
But it's okay.

800
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:54,159
I think this one's tastier.

801
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,760
Mom, your taste is awful.
Don't set me up again.

802
01:03:07,719 --> 01:03:09,880
Your taste is getting too expensive!

803
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:12,280
You only want someone rich.

804
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,119
If it hasn't happened yet, it won't.

805
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:17,800
So you want me to just accept
any man you send my way?

806
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:18,920
I can't do that!

807
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,719
I've studied too hard to settle.

808
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,400
I can't just come home
and sell homemade cream like you, Mom.

809
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,880
Well, what's wrong
with selling homemade cream?

810
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,280
You sound like
you haven't learned your lesson!

811
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,679
Come on, Mom.
How many faces have you ruined?

812
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,239
I've smoothed things over
with so many of your clients.

813
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,280
How much have you wasted on this product?

814
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,239
Come on, Mom.
Please don't risk going to jail for this.

815
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:45,599
If someone reports you again,
I'm not bailing you out anymore.

816
01:03:46,519 --> 01:03:47,599
One more thing.

817
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:49,320
If you want a good son-in-law,

818
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,840
please don't give me
anything else to be embarrassed about!

819
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,159
Gosh!

820
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,400
May these creatures be free.

821
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,159
May they be free from suffering and death.

822
01:04:13,239 --> 01:04:17,800
I dedicate the blessings I receive
to the souls of the departed

823
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:20,480
and to all enemies from past lives.

824
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,880
May they forgive me
and let go of their grudges.

825
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:28,280
Your whole life is sinful.

826
01:04:30,519 --> 01:04:32,760
Do you think
freeing some animals can absolve you?

827
01:04:40,519 --> 01:04:41,519
Did you follow me?

828
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:43,199
Knowing your record,

829
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,119
I'm the one who should ask you that.

830
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:48,920
What a holy occasion.
I was about to share blessings with you.

831
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,639
Are you asking for some?

832
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:53,280
You can't even stick to the Five Precepts.

833
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,800
You have no blessings to share.

834
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,079
Extraordinarily sinful women like you

835
01:04:57,159 --> 01:04:59,000
don't have any goodness left, do they?

836
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:05,320
Hey!

837
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:06,719
What are you doing?

838
01:05:08,119 --> 01:05:09,280
-Hey!
-You know what?

839
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:14,360
I've never wanted to hurt anyone!
But today, I wish you would die!

840
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,880
Then we'd never meet again!

841
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:16,800
-Go away!
-Hey!

842
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,000
-Just go away!
-Hey!

843
01:05:18,519 --> 01:05:20,320
-Let go!
-Miss Khim!

844
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,360
-Careful!
-Miss Khim!

845
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:22,360
-Let go!
-What is it?

846
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,079
-That's him!
-Don't!

847
01:05:26,119 --> 01:05:27,440
Hey!

848
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:35,239
Let's go, Auntie Oon.

849
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,280
I don't want to do any other bad deeds.

850
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:44,159
Saikhim!

851
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
-Saikhim!
-Gosh!

852
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:52,000
Miss Khim.

853
01:05:52,519 --> 01:05:55,519
Gosh, I can't believe
he's actually still alive.

854
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,199
As far as I'm concerned, he's not Gaogla.

855
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:01,679
His looks aside,
he's completely different.

856
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,440
Gosh, but it seems like

857
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:05,800
he's holding a huge grudge against us.

858
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,159
This is nothing
compared to what he did to me.

859
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,440
Miss Khim,

860
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,480
people who aren't a good match

861
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:17,400
are doomed to break up one day.

862
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,199
If it were true love,

863
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,760
you never would have been separated.

864
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:24,920
I never used to regret
meeting him in this life.

865
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:27,440
That was before today.

866
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,159
I can't call it lost love.

867
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:32,320
Just knowing each other was hard enough.

868
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:37,679
Here you go.

869
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:41,639
We're trying to create a new way
to experience tourism.

870
01:06:44,199 --> 01:06:45,360
Hey! Bro!

871
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:49,159
-What happened?
-I fell in the water.

872
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:50,880
I'm lucky Pod helped me.

873
01:06:51,559 --> 01:06:53,519
Hey, how did you fall in?

874
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:55,760
He was trying to catch some fish.

875
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,679
What?

876
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:05,320
Whoa! You're about to get married.
You're still interviewing candidates?

877
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:09,800
What would Khim think if she knew
you were two-timing her, Tanthai?

878
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,599
-Back off.
-Answer me first.

879
01:07:17,559 --> 01:07:19,039
She's partnering with the bank.

880
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,599
Right, I guess that means your dad

881
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:23,639
wants a daughter-in-law, doesn't he?

882
01:07:24,239 --> 01:07:25,760
Sort out your own life, Lita.

883
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,760
I've seen you with countless men.

884
01:07:28,519 --> 01:07:33,400
Hey, Tanthai, don't change the subject.
Who was that woman?

885
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,320
Excuse me.

886
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,840
-Yes?
-Do you have CCTV?

887
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,159
I lost something.

888
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:39,719
Yes, miss. What did you lose?

889
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,960
My friend's boyfriend.

890
01:07:41,559 --> 01:07:43,119
I lost my friend's boyfriend.

891
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:44,920
I guess he was stolen just now.

892
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,239
-Right.
-I just need evidence to expose him with.

893
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:56,800
-Lita…
-Don't touch my phone!

894
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:01,639
Don't call Saikhim about this.
Don't be ridiculous.

895
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:04,360
You look so guilty.

896
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,320
You must be scared
she'll find out you're cheating.

897
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:10,440
Khim is rational.
She doesn't get jealous randomly like you.

898
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:14,119
Yes, she's too rational
to suspect that you're cheating on her!

899
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,000
We're about to get married.

900
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,319
If you're jealous of her for that,

901
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:24,439
try not to show it.

902
01:08:25,039 --> 01:08:27,680
If she finds out that you betrayed her,

903
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:30,680
you'll never marry her in this life,
the next, or any other life.

904
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,239
-Give my phone back to me.
-No.

905
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,560
-Give me my phone back.
-No.

906
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,279
No? Fine.

907
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:39,520
-Give me yours.
-Hey!

908
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,880
-Lita, what are you doing?
-Give it to me now.

909
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:43,880
-Give it to me.
-No.

910
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,680
-What are you doing?
-Just give me my phone back!

911
01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:56,680
This isn't over yet, Tanthai.

912
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:04,600
Lita.

913
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,000
I'll get it for you.

914
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:27,079
Be careful.

915
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:28,920
-Hey!
-Tan!

916
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Thank you.

917
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,159
Put it away in the car and turn on the AC.

918
01:09:59,239 --> 01:10:00,079
Yes, ma'am.

919
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,960
We need someone to give us Wi-Fi.

920
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,479
Let us know if you can share your Wi-Fi.

921
01:10:13,479 --> 01:10:15,840
Will someone really share Wi-Fi with us?

922
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,680
People should share what they can.

923
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:21,039
Who would share this sort of thing?

924
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:25,359
Pod, you have this great food.
Do you ever share it with anyone?

925
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:27,720
-No.
-All right.

926
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:32,680
We'll trade your goat's milk
for someone's Internet connection.

927
01:10:36,119 --> 01:10:37,640
We ask for what they have,

928
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,239
and we give what we can.

929
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:41,840
-Yeah.
-That's not too difficult.

930
01:10:48,439 --> 01:10:49,279
Listen.

931
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,640
If someone around here is interested,

932
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:55,680
they'll hit Accept, and we'll just trade
the goat's milk for their Wi-Fi password.

933
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,199
No one replied. You're full of crap!

934
01:11:04,279 --> 01:11:07,840
Hey! Chill out, little dude!
You're like a moody teenager.

935
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,399
-What's your real age?
-Seven.

936
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:11,319
You're seven?

937
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,760
The same age as my child.

938
01:11:14,359 --> 01:11:15,680
If it had survived,

939
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,119
it would be annoying like you.

940
01:11:42,199 --> 01:11:43,039
Dad!

941
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,239
What is it? Miss Khim, what is it?

942
01:11:58,319 --> 01:11:59,399
Start the car.

943
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,840
What?

944
01:12:07,399 --> 01:12:09,159
Hey! Why did you follow us?

945
01:12:09,239 --> 01:12:11,079
Prepare to pay for what you did.

946
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,640
Hey! What are you doing?

947
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:15,119
Hey! Don't!

948
01:12:19,079 --> 01:12:19,960
You nutjob!

949
01:12:21,399 --> 01:12:22,479
You're totally nuts!

950
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:26,159
You must feel so guilty
about all your bad deeds

951
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:27,800
that you're scared of empty tanks.

952
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:32,640
Are you okay?

953
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:34,680
Start the car.

954
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,479
Gosh.

955
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,960
I thought we'd have no milk left
to trade for Wi-Fi.

956
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:52,239
So you had to fire someone
to get them to settle the case?

957
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,000
He's rotten to the core.

958
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,279
He pretends to be a holy man.

959
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:04,319
I wasn't convinced

960
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:06,239
that he could run a huge business

961
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:07,960
without caring about money.

962
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,239
Tan, what have you heard?

963
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,159
Well, nothing, actually.

964
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:15,720
I've heard nothing.

965
01:13:17,319 --> 01:13:18,560
Taste the soup for me.

966
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:21,920
Come on, taste it.

967
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,439
Here. Careful, it's hot.

968
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,159
-Is it good?
-It's good.

969
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,800
So Tan, what did your family say
about our wedding?

970
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,479
We should have
a small wedding, don't you think?

971
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,000
More people, more problems.

972
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:51,319
I think the wedding should be
about just the two of us.

973
01:13:54,279 --> 01:13:55,760
I think so too.

974
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:59,800
Marriage can't guarantee
that people will truly love each other.

975
01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:04,239
Some people show their true colors
after they get married.

976
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,159
I didn't mean you, Tan.

977
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,199
I'm just observing
what people are like these days.

978
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:24,359
We don't need to get married
to prove our love.

979
01:14:25,159 --> 01:14:27,760
You understand me, and that's all I need.

980
01:14:45,399 --> 01:14:46,239
Did I scare you?

981
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,960
I heard that you check into

982
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:53,159
random lodgings on your app.

983
01:14:55,159 --> 01:14:56,479
My friend owns this place.

984
01:14:57,199 --> 01:15:00,239
When I heard you were staying here,

985
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,319
I got you some room service.

986
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:07,920
How can I be sure
your people won't search my room again?

987
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,439
I could've surprised you in there,

988
01:15:16,039 --> 01:15:17,680
but I chose to wait outside

989
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,039
right here.

990
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,119
My friend's a flight attendant.
He travels abroad a lot.

991
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:51,239
So he rents this place out.
He doesn't even stay here much anyway.

992
01:15:57,439 --> 01:15:59,640
Maybe "friend" isn't the right word.

993
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:04,319
I'm actually his personal trainer.

994
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,479
About that room service,

995
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:24,640
there's more to it.

996
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:42,840
When you exercise your muscles wrong,
they get tense just like this.

997
01:16:46,039 --> 01:16:48,039
You should try a relaxing massage.

998
01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:06,520
When we get married, would this be
a good marital home for you, Khim?

999
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,439
Why wouldn't it be, Tan?

1000
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:14,000
I'm just wondering
if you'd rather live in a big house.

1001
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:16,600
Not at all.

1002
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:20,840
I can live anywhere
as long as it's just the two of us.

1003
01:17:22,479 --> 01:17:23,800
Really, Khim?

1004
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:26,680
Should I have you try staying the night?

1005
01:17:29,239 --> 01:17:30,439
-Well…
-Stay here tonight.

1006
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,560
We'll be married soon.
Don't worry about it.

1007
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:39,279
I'm gonna make coffee.

1008
01:17:39,359 --> 01:17:40,760
Would you like some?

1009
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:45,479
Khim.

1010
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,680
I'm not finished yet.
Why did you change the subject?

1011
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,159
That might be Lita.

1012
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:01,920
I should pick up.

1013
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,880
She's been calling all afternoon.

1014
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,800
Khim, I think it's probably nothing.

1015
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:08,880
I should get it, or she'll be mad at me.

1016
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:09,920
I won't be long.

1017
01:18:18,199 --> 01:18:19,119
Hi, Lita.

1018
01:18:20,199 --> 01:18:22,760
Are you okay?
You've been calling all afternoon.

1019
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:24,720
Khim, have you spoken to Tan today?

1020
01:18:25,319 --> 01:18:27,079
Did he say he saw me?

1021
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:34,439
He's with me now. He didn't mention it.

1022
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:36,680
Really?

1023
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:43,039
And… did he act unusually nice?
Like, did he go out of his way to be nice?

1024
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:45,800
Well…

1025
01:18:49,079 --> 01:18:51,279
He cooked for me.

1026
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:52,760
I knew it.

1027
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:56,319
He's covering up
what he did this afternoon.

1028
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,600
What's going on, Lita?
You're being dramatic.

1029
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:09,119
Khim, you're about to get married.
Try acting like a jealous wife.

1030
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:15,960
Is he being so nice to you
because he did something to hurt you?

1031
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,760
Figure out what he's feeling guilty about.

1032
01:19:20,439 --> 01:19:22,960
If you can't figure it out,
don't marry him.

1033
01:19:23,479 --> 01:19:24,319
Okay, bye.

1034
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:43,439
What's wrong, Khim?

1035
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,800
Such tense muscles.

1036
01:19:59,319 --> 01:20:02,960
When did you stop going to the gym?

1037
01:20:10,199 --> 01:20:12,520
Let me relax these tense muscles.

1038
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,800
Where did you see Lita today?

1039
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,479
This afternoon?

1040
01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:18,680
I was having lunch with my dad
and a client and ran into Lita.

1041
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:23,359
Which client?

1042
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:30,520
I can tell you, but you don't know them.

1043
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:36,680
By the way, about tonight,

1044
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,800
are you staying here?

1045
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:02,159
Is someone staying in the place next door?

1046
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:03,640
Didn't you tell me

1047
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:05,279
it's usually empty?

1048
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:09,880
Stop changing the subject.

1049
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,359
If you're not ready to stay the night,
you should just say so.

1050
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:18,520
Well…

1051
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:29,399
I…

1052
01:22:42,439 --> 01:22:43,279
Hey!

1053
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:53,159
I started boiling water
but forgot to turn on the extractor fan!

1054
01:22:53,239 --> 01:22:54,199
It's okay, Khim.

1055
01:23:01,319 --> 01:23:02,159
Come here.

1056
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,199
Please send someone up here.

1057
01:23:10,359 --> 01:23:11,199
It's okay.

1058
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:12,960
-Yes?
-I'm sorry.

1059
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:20,800
What the hell?

1060
01:23:22,119 --> 01:23:23,479
I nearly had him.

1061
01:23:25,159 --> 01:23:27,039
The smoke alarm went off,

1062
01:23:27,119 --> 01:23:28,439
but I've shut it down.

1063
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:53,039
Hey. I didn't know you were staying here.

1064
01:23:53,119 --> 01:23:55,119
And I didn't know you were here.

1065
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:58,319
So that alarm just now was…

1066
01:23:59,439 --> 01:24:02,800
That was mine.
I was boiling water but forgot about it.

1067
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,680
I guess everything's fine now.

1068
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:07,840
What's going on?

1069
01:24:11,159 --> 01:24:12,279
Prim!

1070
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:23,520
Why are you here?

1071
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,159
The same reason as you, I guess.

1072
01:24:25,239 --> 01:24:27,079
Did you two trigger the alarm?

1073
01:24:27,159 --> 01:24:28,159
Did it get that hot?

1074
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:36,119
Gosh. Don't do anything extreme next time.
You frightened the whole building.

1075
01:24:40,199 --> 01:24:42,520
It's safe. The alarms have all stopped.

1076
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:43,880
Thank you.

1077
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,439
Sorry to bother you.

1078
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:34,399
I need to rest. You should leave.

1079
01:25:38,119 --> 01:25:38,960
Hey!

1080
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,359
You're just kicking me out?

1081
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,680
Since when did they know each other?

1082
01:26:25,039 --> 01:26:27,720
KIDAKARN (5)
GROUP CHAT

1083
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,159
PRIMPRAO

1084
01:26:29,239 --> 01:26:31,920
I'm not coming home tonight.

1085
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:32,920
She's nasty.

1086
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:35,239
She moves so fast.

1087
01:27:06,199 --> 01:27:08,800
TIME FOR ROUND TWO

1088
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:23,039
Tonight, I'll try clean eating.
It might be good for my health.

1089
01:27:32,279 --> 01:27:33,279
You're still here?

1090
01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:35,199
I want a bath too.

1091
01:28:05,359 --> 01:28:07,720
Women like Saikhim don't deserve
good relationships.

1092
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:11,640
You watch your boyfriend at all hours.
Are you scared he'll get away?

1093
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:15,279
No, I'm scared he'll want something
more casual like you do.

1094
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,760
Don't tell me you came to see Gaogla.

1095
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:18,680
What if I did?

1096
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:20,279
Are you jealous?

1097
01:28:20,359 --> 01:28:22,560
We can use this video to expose them

1098
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:24,720
for using the app
as a front for sex workers.

1099
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,119
Deal with this father and daughter pair.

1100
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,279
If you can't handle it,

1101
01:28:29,359 --> 01:28:31,079
I'll deal with them myself.

1102
01:28:31,159 --> 01:28:32,399
Show your true colors.

1103
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:33,960
Stop faking and playing dumb.

1104
01:28:34,039 --> 01:28:37,520
I'm starting to wonder
if you care about Saikhim's feelings.

1105
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:38,520
Not at all.

1106
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:41,039
I don't care about those people.

1107
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:45,279
Go and watch them.
I must know what they are to each other.

1108
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:21,279
