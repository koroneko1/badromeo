00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,400
THIS FICTIONAL SERIES IS INTENDED
FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY

2
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,879
Return to England immediately.

3
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,560
End of discussion.

4
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,520
I'm pregnant.

5
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,639
Can you please tell me

6
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,080
how I should begin?

7
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,439
Stay here today.

8
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,479
The clinic will see you tomorrow.
We'll go together.

9
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,280
Give me back my car's ECU,

10
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,759
or I'll tell my uncle

11
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,319
that Sakhim ran off with you.

12
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,039
My mom is renting this house.
They won't look for you here.

13
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,120
Miss Khim ran away from home yesterday.

14
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,479
May we search your property?

15
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,639
You asked me how I would raise the kid.

16
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,000
This is how.

17
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,400
I'll raise it where I grew up.

18
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,280
We haven't found her.

19
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,159
We're trying to trace her phone signal.

20
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,360
I think Gaogla is using that kid
to manipulate Khim

21
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,759
to defy us, actually, Uncle.

22
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,120
If we dance to his tune,

23
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,479
he'll have the upper hand.

24
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,719
Do we have better options?

25
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,560
Why don't you try cutting her off, Uncle?

26
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,000
For such greedy people,

27
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,000
women without money are worth nothing,
and Saikhim is no exception.

28
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,919
If you act tough…

29
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,520
and actually cut ties,

30
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,919
Saikhim will realize

31
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,199
that what that man loves is your money.

32
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,199
Gla! Wait, is it really you?

33
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,360
It really is you!

34
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:46,360
Wow. What are you doing here?
From a distance, I wasn't sure it was you.

35
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,279
Up close,

36
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,839
it's obviously you.

37
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,560
Wow, it really is you!

38
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:55,040
What happened to your face?

39
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,879
-Who did you fight with?
-Easy!

40
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,800
I'm just heading home this way,
and I thought I should eat.

41
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,920
Whoa, if you turn up like this,
Dad will die of shock.

42
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,879
Are you going home now?
We can go together.

43
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,519
She's coming with us.

44
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,319
I see! Move over.

45
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,079
So you're the one
who's going to the Well-Being School?

46
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,800
Hey, it's me, Gloyjai.

47
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,040
The same Gloyjai
you spoke to on the phone.

48
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,000
So let's go straight to the plantation.

49
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,040
By the way, this is my older brother.

50
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,079
His name is Gaogla.

51
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,759
Gla, since she's coming
to our plantation too,

52
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,680
you drive her there, okay?

53
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:41,720
I'll follow you.

54
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,000
Sure.

55
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,439
See you at the plantation.

56
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,879
Drive safely, all right? Be careful, okay?

57
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,920
She's your sister?

58
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,839
Yeah.

59
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,800
She thinks you're a guest
going to the plantation.

60
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,199
You have a plantation,
a homestay, and a little sister.

61
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,720
Is there anything else
I don't know about you?

62
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,160
You'll know when we get there.

63
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,560
I'll bring you home

64
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,480
to meet my dad.

65
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,720
I'll introduce you to everyone.

66
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,360
Wait. Hey, what will you introduce me as?

67
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,079
My partner. I'll say we're having a baby.

68
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,040
That's crazy!

69
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,639
If you say that,

70
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,360
what will they think of me?

71
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,000
Can I say
we had a one-night stand and eloped?

72
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,279
Are you nuts? You can't say that either.

73
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,319
You don't want me to lie
or tell the truth.

74
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,000
So define our relationship.

75
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,800
Well…

76
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,439
-Dad.
-Why come back?

77
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,720
And who's that?

78
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,439
-Well…
-Hello, sir.

79
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,279
Dad!

80
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:50,800
Vroom.

81
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,279
She's here to take the course.

82
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,839
She's from Bangkok.

83
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,079
-Actually--
-Listen, Dad.

84
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,439
I asked Gla

85
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,360
to drive her from the market.

86
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,439
They happened to meet.

87
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,399
It's not his problem.

88
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,800
Why involve him?

89
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,120
You, Gloy,

90
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,360
bring our guest inside.

91
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,240
Of course.

92
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,279
I'll take those.

93
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,600
There.

94
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,959
Come with me, please.

95
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,560
Right this way.

96
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,759
Right this way. Let's go.

97
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,519
Turn right here.

98
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,559
Come on.

99
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,879
All right. Here we are.

100
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,200
This is our school.
There are boards for the kids to write on.

101
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,080
There are the boards.
There's an upper floor too. See?

102
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:13,879
What a state you've come back in.
What did you do this time?

103
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:17,879
Didn't you say
you wouldn't be stuck here anymore?

104
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,360
I got a woman pregnant.

105
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,399
I knew it!

106
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,960
If nothing had happened,
you wouldn't have come crawling back!

107
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,679
I wanna bring her here to raise it.

108
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,120
You good-for-nothing.
How would you take care of them?

109
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,519
So you won't let us stay?

110
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,840
Damn right! I won't!

111
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,759
The kid can stay.

112
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,000
But you can't stay!

113
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,000
Go and change your ways first.
Then come back and be its dad!

114
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,799
Come on. This way, please.

115
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:30,000
Come. I'll take your bags.

116
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,200
I thought you weren't coming.

117
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,720
You didn't answer my calls.

118
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:44,159
I'll show you around, okay?

119
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:47,440
This way, I'll show you
lots of pretty places.

120
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,360
Let's go.

121
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,559
Why are there so many kids here?

122
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,879
Right, I forgot to mention
that apart from teaching self-reliance,

123
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,159
we do homeschooling.

124
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,039
These kids' parents aren't here.

125
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,960
The kids were sent here
to live with their grandparents.

126
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,639
Let's go.

127
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,720
Dad decided to provide daycare
while their families are working.

128
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,960
In the evening, they all go home.

129
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,000
We take care of all the kids
whose families can't cope alone.

130
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,320
I'd like you to give me sole custody.

131
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,799
I can raise just one kid.

132
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,240
So this is how it is.

133
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,039
Let's go over there.

134
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,679
Come on.

135
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,159
It must be nice to live here.

136
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,039
See this house?

137
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,919
It's called a mud house.

138
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,399
A mud house?

139
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,039
Dad teaches mud house construction
and lessons on self-reliance.

140
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,080
Here,

141
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,480
we teach people to live with nature,

142
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,600
spend less money,

143
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,559
live simple lives,

144
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,080
and focus on what's important.

145
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,039
By the way,

146
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,279
what's your name?

147
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,759
You can call me Khim.

148
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,679
Khim.

149
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:21,000
Khim, you did a great job
driving alone all this way.

150
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,159
But don't worry.
I promise it's very safe around here.

151
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,559
-Let's go.
-Wait.

152
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:32,559
So… about your brother…

153
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,000
You mean Gla?

154
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,279
Are you afraid of him?
You don't have to be.

155
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,039
He never hangs around for long.
He comes and goes.

156
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,559
Right.

157
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,519
So, did he grow up here too?

158
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,720
Yeah, he did.
But he moved out a long time ago.

159
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,279
He might be a bit rebellious and chaotic,
but don't hold that against him.

160
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,799
I guess he doesn't see
beautiful women that often,

161
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,159
so he can't contain himself.

162
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,639
By the way, you'll learn about food today.

163
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,519
Dad will show you
how to harvest veggies to cook with.

164
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:08,879
Are you ready?

165
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,559
-Yeah. Okay.
-Come on.

166
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:15,879
In a world like ours,
we never have to go hungry.

167
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,960
To be self-reliant is to know
how to live on what we have.

168
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,120
This is duckweed.
Some people call it Asian watermeal.

169
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,840
Psst.

170
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,480
I scooped it from the pond just now.

171
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,159
It may look weird,
but it's very beneficial.

172
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,000
It's high in protein.

173
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,159
So today, I'll toast some duckweed
for you to have a taste.

174
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,399
To begin,

175
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,720
you spoon it up to drain it

176
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,919
just like this.

177
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,279
And then,

178
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,080
we take all this filth and throw it away.

179
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:11,759
By the way, honey, it's even better

180
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,960
when anyone wants favors

181
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,039
because we can give them these blessings.

182
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,080
Yes, we give them these blessings.

183
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,360
And we give them these blessings.

184
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,799
We can give them
a whole basket of blessings.

185
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:48,240
Hey!

186
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,559
Watch it, Gloy.

187
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:52,600
Well,

188
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:54,360
I guess Dad taught you a lesson.

189
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,360
Come on, man. Who did you get pregnant?

190
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,919
Dad almost lost it, you know?

191
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,960
Back off, kid.
Keep your nose out of my business.

192
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:06,240
Hey, I'm not sticking my nose in it.
I'm just curious, that's all.

193
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:07,799
So, your girlfriend,

194
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,360
who is she?

195
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,919
She's not an exotic dancer, right?

196
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,440
What?

197
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,759
With your reputation,

198
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,080
if exotic dancers don't want you,
then who would?

199
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,360
-Damn.
-What?

200
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,279
Don't go yet. Let's talk first.

201
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,279
Gla!

202
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:25,919
I want to talk to you!

203
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,480
Damn.

204
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,679
Guess we can't stay here after all.

205
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,080
Your dad's unhappy about it, isn't he?
I can tell he knows the truth.

206
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,759
Let's stay for now.

207
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:49,639
We'll leave tomorrow.

208
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,679
Where else would we go?

209
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,399
Admit it.

210
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,399
You're not ready to take care of this kid.

211
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,039
I'm not the one we should worry about.

212
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,879
I can go anywhere.

213
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,960
I just don't want you
to struggle in these eight months.

214
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:10,840
Once it's born,
we can go our separate ways.

215
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:14,799
If I don't take care of you properly,
your dad will mock me.

216
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,200
-You jerk!
-Dad.

217
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,360
You can't be trusted!

218
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,279
What, Dad?

219
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,639
-Damn it. I'll teach you!
-Hey! Dad!

220
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,480
-What are you doing here?
-Dad, enough.

221
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:45,559
-Dad!
-You…

222
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,399
What are you doing here?

223
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,399
Wait, mister!

224
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,559
What's going on?

225
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,159
Did he molest you?

226
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:57,840
-You little--
-Wait!

227
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,720
-No.
-Dad! Listen first!

228
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,960
Why? Well?

229
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,399
-Please calm down.
-Dad!

230
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,400
-No!
-Mister…

231
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,559
You depraved sex addict.
You sowed your wild oats everywhere!

232
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,599
Mister, please calm down.

233
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,960
Were you molested?

234
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:14,960
No, he didn't.

235
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,759
Hey, Dad, you're out of line--

236
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,920
-Out of line?
-Dad!

237
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,680
How dare you talk back?
And why did you come in here?

238
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,319
Why can't I be here?

239
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,240
She's my woman!

240
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,200
-What?
-She's the woman I got pregnant.

241
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:31,640
You're his woman?

242
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,000
Did you abduct her?

243
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:43,920
Dad!

244
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:46,200
Who do you think I am, Dad?

245
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,559
You're so young.
How did Gla fool you into this?

246
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,920
Or did you come willingly?

247
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,400
She just happened to get pregnant
with me, that's all.

248
00:17:58,839 --> 00:17:59,720
It just happened?

249
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,160
Look, she's pregnant.

250
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,079
How dare you say, "that's all"?

251
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:05,960
She's my girlfriend.

252
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:08,039
What's wrong with having a baby together?

253
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,160
We love each other
and want to have a family together.

254
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,279
Come with me.

255
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,400
What about your parents?
Can they accept this?

256
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:32,920
I can feed my family, Dad.

257
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,039
We'll take care of this

258
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,279
despite what anyone says.

259
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,440
You took advantage of someone's daughter.
No parent would forgive you for that!

260
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,160
Dad, you're under no obligation
to do anything for us.

261
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,599
We'll never be burdens to you.

262
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,039
Come on.

263
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:56,160
Gla! You're hotheaded and impatient.

264
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:59,119
You good-for-nothing.
What have you ever done right?

265
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,279
I don't think you'll manage
to take care of anyone.

266
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,519
Come on.

267
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,920
Why did you lie like that?

268
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,400
If I'd told the truth,

269
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,319
he would've dragged me
to beg for your dad's forgiveness.

270
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,599
Do you want our unborn baby
to lose its dad?

271
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,000
Now I'm not so sure
that you can cope with raising this kid.

272
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,720
But this is the only place
where your dad won't look for our baby.

273
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,000
And what'll happen when I go home?

274
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,839
We'll just say we broke up.

275
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,519
Hey. Wait.

276
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:52,319
So if I stay here,
I have to pretend to be your girlfriend?

277
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,799
Just pretend, you know,
like one of those TV dramas.

278
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,400
For up to eight months?

279
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,519
I can't manage that.

280
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,480
You don't mind being pregnant,
but you mind living with me, right?

281
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,240
No, I don't mind.

282
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,680
Don't do this for me.

283
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,519
Don't be my girlfriend.

284
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:14,240
Just be our baby's mom.

285
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,559
That's what I'm afraid of.

286
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,519
So let's be roommates. Let's share a room.

287
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,279
I'm a gentleman. I'm not easily tempted.

288
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,680
We know that's not true.
Say something else.

289
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm not your type

290
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,759
just like you're not my type.

291
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,119
Does that sound better?

292
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:55,880
Finished your shower?

293
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,680
Good water pressure?

294
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:30,640
Take your shower.

295
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,880
You're the one who dodges the question

296
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,920
You're the only one
who dodges the question

297
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:07,519
You're the one who dodges the question

298
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:09,960
Will we survive?

299
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,200
The power went off.

300
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,200
Don't worry. I forgot to tell you.

301
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,880
We have blackouts here some nights.

302
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,039
So… what do we do?

303
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,079
We do this.

304
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,000
Afraid of ghosts?

305
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,160
No.

306
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,799
Why are you so scared?

307
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,200
Don't.

308
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,759
It's a prayer book.

309
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:32,240
It keeps ghosts away.

310
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,000
Pray. Find inner peace.

311
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,319
Avoid unwholesome thoughts.

312
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,319
Don't overthink or complicate things.
Try go behave virtuously.

313
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:41,960
Tame your heart.

314
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,480
Think of your parents' faces.

315
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,559
Making fun of me?

316
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:33,279
Having nice dreams?

317
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,079
I'm back.

318
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,160
Hey.

319
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,240
There it is.

320
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:20,599
Rich kids can't live
without these things, can they?

321
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,599
They have to…

322
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:25,400
Give me that.

323
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,079
I'll take care of it.

324
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,319
Gloy?

325
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,519
Hi, Khim. You're awake already?
Are you hungry yet?

326
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:47,400
Can I help?

327
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,519
Since you're not a client,

328
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:52,839
Dad says you don't have to do the course.
You can just live with us.

329
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:57,720
Right now, the kids and I
are preparing to cook.

330
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,279
What's on the menu today?

331
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:04,200
There's no fried chicken
and no grilled chicken on the menu.

332
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:07,559
We call it the potluck menu.

333
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:11,480
-The potluck menu?
-Yeah.

334
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:14,039
Today, everyone has to find
ingredients to cook with.

335
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,279
Once in a while, we trade these eggs
with our neighbors instead of shopping.

336
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:23,200
Hello there.

337
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,079
These kids have to speak to them,
get to know them,

338
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,720
and trade with them,

339
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,599
taking whatever they're given.

340
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,920
They either give us
veggies from their gardens,

341
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,039
or their animals.

342
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:37,920
You see, Dad teaches us
to appreciate the value of food.

343
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,960
It's not easy to grow
or to raise each food item.

344
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:43,480
That's why we shouldn't waste food.

345
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,519
Come on.

346
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:54,799
Sometimes, instead of eggs,

347
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,000
we offer our time in exchange.

348
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:59,880
Around here, we don't have
convenience stores.

349
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,799
Instead, we give away, harvest,
and consume what's "conveniently" there.

350
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,559
We're not just cashless.

351
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:10,039
Actually, some days,
we don't use any kind of money at all.

352
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,279
Look, honey.

353
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,759
This is the potluck menu.
It depends on what we can find each day.

354
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,880
We have to consume
what we have and what we can find,

355
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,759
not whatever we want.

356
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,119
Kids, wash your hands.

357
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,160
You don't mind this?

358
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,000
Actually, I think it'll be great.

359
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:24,920
Okay.

360
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:26,640
Get in line.

361
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:32,599
Get in line first, kids.

362
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,200
Come on.

363
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,079
We collected these veggies.

364
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,400
This is Uncle Kaew's tofu.

365
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,960
Sir?

366
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:55,359
Did you forget something?

367
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,559
What did I forget?

368
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:59,039
You didn't add these.

369
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,079
Okay, add them.

370
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,279
What are those?

371
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,680
Would you like some?

372
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,440
-You'll share them with me?
-Yes.

373
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,359
All right. I'll have some.

374
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,640
Don't.

375
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,200
It's crunchy.

376
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:22,279
You like to eat tadpoles?

377
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,519
Baby frogs.

378
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:26,319
-What?
-You like them?

379
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:45,519
-They're everywhere.
-Go to her.

380
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,240
Go on.

381
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,799
Ew!

382
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,000
I ate… frogs?

383
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,759
Yeah. Tadpoles.

384
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:25,119
Well?

385
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,920
You trust me with our kid yet?

386
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,039
I can imagine how it will grow up.

387
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,920
Not as deprived as you thought, right?

388
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,720
These kids' lives are better than mine
even if their parents aren't here.

389
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:47,079
Dad makes everyone here happy instantly
with no exceptions.

390
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:50,480
We don't have to be rich or ready for it.

391
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,720
If everything had to be ready in advance,
these kids would never have been born.

392
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,839
In that case,

393
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,799
our unborn child doesn't need
a mom like me, right?

394
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:11,320
Of course you're needed.

395
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:15,360
You just have to accept
that our lives can't always be perfect.

396
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,440
No one here was raised by their parents.

397
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,880
We'd be waiting a long time
for the whole family to be reunited.

398
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:24,519
Here, you get the love you need.

399
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:28,440
You don't have to be a good student.
If you can get dressed and wipe your butt,

400
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:29,840
you can be happy right now.

401
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,159
Being happy with what we have is the best.

402
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,199
Yes?

403
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:16,960
I want to ask you for a favor.

404
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:21,719
I'd like to take a year off
to find myself.

405
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,960
Don't sugarcoat it.

406
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,960
Say you don't want
to go back to university.

407
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:32,519
You probably know about my problem.

408
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,440
I want to use this time
to solve it myself.

409
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:40,039
How will you do that? Explain.

410
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:47,880
In my year off,

411
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:51,239
I'll have my baby.

412
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,079
After the birth,

413
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,159
I'll give him sole custody

414
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,800
and go back to university.

415
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,840
You have the nerve to have the baby?

416
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:04,079
What about how that makes me look?

417
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:07,519
Do you care more about that man
than your own future?

418
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,199
Has he brainwashed you again?

419
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,760
Dad.

420
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:15,840
Life may have taken unexpected turns,

421
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:17,840
but maybe that's okay.

422
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,000
Who said it's okay?

423
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:22,679
You're losing an opportunity of a lifetime
for this nonsense?

424
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,519
And all for what?

425
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:31,599
And you think my life is good right now?

426
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:33,119
Better than being a delinquent!

427
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,880
This obsession is clouding your mind.

428
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,800
You've dominated my whole life.

429
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:41,840
Is that so different?

430
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,760
Of course it is.

431
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,320
Who the hell is that bastard?

432
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,360
He's not even honest with you.

433
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,039
He's using your unborn baby to trap you.

434
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,039
He loves your money.

435
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,079
He doesn't love you.

436
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,239
If you're stupid enough

437
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:00,559
to let him leech off you,

438
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,320
run into his arms.

439
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:04,599
With a daughter this stupid,

440
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:07,159
I wouldn't mind being childless.

441
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,840
I wonder.

442
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:11,320
If you weren't my daughter,

443
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,719
would he want you?

444
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:16,480
So…

445
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,280
I guess you still won't forgive me?

446
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,199
Of course not.

447
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:28,000
At least dogs can be tamed.

448
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,599
Children who disappoint you

449
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:32,239
aren't worth having.

450
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:45,840
You haven't changed, Dad.

451
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:48,599
Did you know that when I was little,

452
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,559
I would pretend to be asleep

453
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,320
so that you'd pick me up
and take me to my bed?

454
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,000
But you never did that, not even once.

455
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,519
Forget picking me up.

456
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,760
You probably don't even want
to look at me anymore.

457
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:12,800
I understand now

458
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,760
why I've been so unhappy for so long.

459
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:21,639
It's because you

460
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:26,280
set the bar too high for me.

461
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,800
That's why life is hard.

462
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,440
I have to be a good student,

463
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,880
I have to go to a Top Five university,

464
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:38,119
I have to live a life
that others would envy,

465
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:40,280
and I mustn't embarrass you.

466
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,440
It's too difficult, Dad.

467
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:45,239
I'm so tired.

468
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:49,880
I don't think I can do this anymore.

469
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:52,719
I understand now

470
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,599
why I've been so unhappy for so long.

471
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:58,519
It's because you

472
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,480
set the bar too high for me.

473
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,239
That's why life is hard.

474
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,679
I mustn't embarrass you.

475
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,599
It's too difficult, Dad.

476
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,840
Everything…

477
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,079
that I've done for you…

478
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:29,679
has it really hurt you this much?

479
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,280
I'm a bad father, aren't I?

480
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:49,760
Okay, this square is your house.

481
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,159
That's Gloy's team's house.
This is my team's house.

482
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:54,039
We all have to stand on the houses.

483
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:56,480
-All right.
-Okay? Don't stand on the cement floor.

484
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:57,800
We all stand on the houses.

485
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,719
-Are you ready? Are you?
-I'm ready!

486
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,639
Go!

487
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:01,639
-Hurry!
-Go on!

488
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:02,559
Stand here.

489
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:04,000
-There.
-Can you fit on?

490
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,599
-Did you all make it?
-Yeah!

491
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:07,000
Both teams made it.

492
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:07,960
It's a draw!

493
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:09,079
Yay!

494
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:10,079
Clap your hands.

495
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:11,280
It's a draw.

496
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,400
-What's the game called?
-Come on.

497
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,880
-"Come In."
-All right.

498
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,400
-Come on.
-New round.

499
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,719
-Now come in.
-We'll fold the houses in half.

500
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,599
-All right?
-Can we play too, Dad?

501
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:24,039
Right. Okay. What do you think?

502
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:25,880
-Sure. Let's play.
-Gloy, count them.

503
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,280
-Count the players.
-Wait.

504
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,519
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
One, two, three, four, five.

505
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:32,079
Dad is out. Too many people.

506
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:33,800
-I'll be the referee.
-Okay? Good.

507
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,159
-Now fold the houses in half.
-All right.

508
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,320
-There.
-All right.

509
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,599
-In this round, the houses are smaller.
-Half the size.

510
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:45,960
And we have more players.

511
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:48,280
You all must stand on the houses.
Are you ready?

512
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,119
-Ready!
-Ready? And your team?

513
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:51,119
Ready?

514
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:53,000
Go!

515
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,079
Both teams made it.

516
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:06,920
Another draw.

517
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,679
Get ready.

518
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,840
See, everyone?

519
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,559
Whether our house is big or small,
it's not a problem.

520
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,440
As long as we love,

521
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:17,599
support, and care for each other,
we can always be together.

522
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:24,840
Serves you right.

523
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,880
Not so hard.

524
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,599
You thought you were so tough.

525
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,000
Stay still.

526
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:39,000
You still wanna show everyone
that you're a tough guy?

527
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:42,320
When the baby's born,
I'll show you that I can lift you both.

528
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,639
By then,

529
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,880
I might not be here anymore.

530
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:01,199
It's a long way off.

531
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,000
I can pick you up when you're nearly due.

532
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,440
Take good care of it, okay?

533
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:20,440
We can both take care of it already.
This stage of pregnancy is important too.

534
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,000
We need you here.

535
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,079
Good job cheering me up.

536
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,960
You can change your mind and stay with us.

537
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,199
Right.

538
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,039
Would you really leave me and the baby?

539
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:16,760
I know you're not a cruel person.

540
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,639
You're just scared, right?

541
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,159
It's late.

542
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:03,400
Let's go to sleep.
We have to get up early.

543
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:34,840
THE WELL-BEING SCHOOL

544
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:01,719
Khim.

545
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:03,800
Are you okay?

546
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:08,559
Gla…

547
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,519
Khim, have some water.

548
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,599
Whoa, this is serious.

549
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:31,199
What? What's serious?

550
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,079
You're seriously into her.

551
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,880
I saw you running around.

552
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:39,480
Okay, you guys take care of the kids.

553
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:41,480
Think of it as parenting practice.

554
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,440
Where's Dad?

555
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:48,719
Well, I don't know.
Maybe he went to deliver veggies.

556
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:46,559
You called me? Which one is he?

557
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:48,119
Right. It's this gentleman.

558
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,679
Chrysanthemum tea from our own plantation.
Mom had it when she was carrying Gloyjai.

559
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,480
I looked up chrysanthemum blossoms.

560
00:52:21,559 --> 00:52:24,559
They can soothe mouth ulcers
as well as light-headedness.

561
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:27,199
I guess this might be good
for your nausea.

562
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,679
Please sit.

563
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:17,400
Mr. Songseen,

564
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,800
I want to talk about our kids.

565
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:24,360
I'll take responsibility
for the damage to your daughter's life.

566
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,519
If you don't mind,
my son wants to marry Saikhim.

567
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:35,199
Is it the bride-price?

568
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,280
Take it back.

569
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:41,559
You think your son is a match
for my daughter?

570
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:46,000
Even if he died and were reborn,
I doubt he'd be enough.

571
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:51,400
If you can't love your own daughter,

572
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,079
let me adopt her.

573
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:04,159
Your own son grew up a degenerate.

574
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:08,400
You think you'd be
a better father than me?

575
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,639
My daughter would end up
a good-for-nothing like him anyway.

576
00:54:13,239 --> 00:54:14,840
A parent's word is sacred.

577
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:17,960
Whatever we keep saying they are,

578
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,719
in the end, that's who they'll be.

579
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,119
Do not preach at me!

580
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:24,960
I'm not preaching. I'm just warning you.

581
00:54:25,719 --> 00:54:28,760
From now on,
no matter what happens in her life,

582
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,039
I will make her proud of herself again.

583
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:34,239
Then, at least,

584
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,559
they'll be better parents than you.

585
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,719
…all right?

586
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:54,199
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

587
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,119
No problem.

588
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,599
Do you crave something special
that'll soothe your nausea?

589
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,800
This is enough for me.

590
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,639
Do you want that?

591
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,400
-Hi there.
-Hello.

592
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,639
-One set, please.
-Sure.

593
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:22,639
I'll buy you a drink.

594
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,239
Two bottles of water, please.

595
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,480
Sure.

596
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,719
That's Dad's car.

597
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,639
Where is he?

598
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:54,679
I'm doing the deliveries today.

599
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,840
Why is he here too?

600
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:02,400
Maybe he's around here.

601
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,480
Try calling him.

602
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,119
Sorry. That number can't be reached…

603
00:56:12,199 --> 00:56:13,639
His phone's turned off or dead.

604
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:30,159
Where has he gone?

605
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:31,840
It's late and he's not back.

606
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,239
If he wasn't delivering veggies too,
then where did he go?

607
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,079
Why did he leave his car at the market?

608
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:42,000
-Gloy.
-Yeah?

609
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:43,280
Find the spare keys.

610
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,320
I'll search the car for clues.

611
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,880
Sure.

612
00:56:56,519 --> 00:56:58,639
Gla!

613
00:56:58,719 --> 00:56:59,559
What?

614
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:03,760
What's this number?
Why did Dad write it down?

615
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,440
That's a Bangkok number.

616
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,719
Maybe he went to Bangkok.

617
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,039
Okay, I'll call the number.

618
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,239
Hello.

619
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:18,119
Luxe Hotel.

620
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:22,960
He must have gone to see my dad.

621
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:30,239
How does my dad know yours?

622
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:38,440
Dad asked me to grab your ID card
and make a photocopy of it.

623
00:57:38,519 --> 00:57:40,239
I guess he figured it out.

624
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,840
This is bad.

625
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:45,440
If they meet each other,

626
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:47,159
Dad will get hurt for sure.

627
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,320
Hey, the minibus is coming.

628
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:06,719
Dad!

629
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:14,760
What are you doing here?

630
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,320
Waiting for you, of course.

631
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,119
You went to Bangkok?

632
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:21,639
You should be at school by now.

633
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,800
Go on!

634
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:35,400
Dad!

635
00:58:54,519 --> 00:58:55,360
Uncle?

636
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,440
You went to see my dad, right?

637
00:58:58,519 --> 00:59:01,800
Yes, I went to ask his permission
for Gla to marry you.

638
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,719
Dad!

639
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,960
He would say we're beneath him.

640
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:08,320
Why did you go looking for trouble?

641
00:59:09,639 --> 00:59:10,559
You abducted her,

642
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:13,320
got her pregnant,
and whisked her away from home, right?

643
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,360
He told you that?

644
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,400
You're not dating like you claimed.

645
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,199
Did my dad insult you?

646
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,039
Did he hurt you?

647
00:59:25,639 --> 00:59:26,480
Are you hurt?

648
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:27,400
Hey.

649
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,679
You have the cheek to care?

650
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,719
He said he has no daughter to give away.

651
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,559
He's cut off his own daughter.

652
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:36,639
It's all your fault.

653
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,920
He told me that he disowned you

654
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:42,800
for daring to keep the kid.

655
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:47,440
Khim?

656
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:49,840
Is it true?

657
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,960
Why didn't you tell me you spoke to him?

658
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,159
I've only ever looked after myself.

659
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:01,920
I've never had to take responsibility
for anyone else's life.

660
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:04,800
If you're willing to take my baby,

661
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,679
I'd like to leave it here with you.

662
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,679
I wouldn't ask more of you than that.

663
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,320
But I'm sure that you all would take
better care of it than I could.

664
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:18,519
So I decided to have the baby.

665
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:21,039
And after the birth,

666
01:00:21,559 --> 01:00:24,440
if you couldn't go home,
where would you live?

667
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:29,800
I'll have it figured out by then.

668
01:00:30,679 --> 01:00:33,719
For now, I need time to readjust, please.

669
01:00:45,159 --> 01:00:46,000
Well?

670
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:48,400
Do you see now?

671
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,639
You see what happens
when you let emotions run your life?

672
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:53,719
You wanted to care for the baby,

673
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,920
but you didn't help her,
and now she's alone.

674
01:00:58,119 --> 01:00:58,960
Your decisions

675
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:02,960
break her heart, you know that?

676
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:20,639
Khim!

677
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,119
You don't have to feel guilty
because of me.

678
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,280
You've done enough to make it up to me.

679
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:32,960
I do want to take care of you.

680
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,599
But I know your future is better
than being stuck with me.

681
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,079
So I didn't commit to asking you
to live with me.

682
01:01:41,559 --> 01:01:43,519
I don't want to drag you down with me.

683
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,360
If you don't mind,

684
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:48,960
let's live here together.

685
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:52,840
I'm serious.

686
01:01:53,559 --> 01:01:54,559
It's not just the kid.

687
01:01:54,639 --> 01:01:56,000
I can look after you too.

688
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:58,480
I'm not rich,

689
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,760
but I promise that with me,

690
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,519
you won't go hungry, you'll sleep well,

691
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,360
and most importantly,

692
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,639
you'll be happy from now
until the day you die.

693
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:21,000
But you said I wasn't your type.

694
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,599
I'm not into rich girls.

695
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:27,840
You aren't one now.

696
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:31,760
If you don't have expensive tastes,
I can look after you.

697
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,400
So what do you say?

698
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,079
Would you live here with me?

699
01:02:41,239 --> 01:02:43,320
Who would I be to you here?

700
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,119
You'd be my lady.

701
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,239
And the mother of our child.

702
01:02:55,719 --> 01:02:58,639
You're being so sweet and silly.
Will you regret it later?

703
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:00,000
No.

704
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:05,320
I won't regret a single word
that I've said today.

705
01:03:20,679 --> 01:03:21,880
Let's go home together.

706
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,360
What are you doing?

707
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,159
Don't couples take each other's photo?

708
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:58,920
-Khim?
-Yeah?

709
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:04,559
Hey!

710
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:07,480
Khim,

711
01:06:07,559 --> 01:06:08,880
we've come this far.

712
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,679
We…

713
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,760
Gla!

714
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:21,199
Dad asked me to stay with Khim.

715
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,079
Hey! How come?

716
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:27,119
Well, well.

717
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:30,440
There.

718
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,599
Dad said that if you're not married,

719
01:06:34,679 --> 01:06:36,960
you must never sleep together, ever!

720
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,639
Got it?

721
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:43,679
Khim.

722
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,800
-Let's go, Khim.
-Stop!

723
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,599
Wait. Don't you dare run away together.
Dad would kill you for sure!

724
01:06:52,719 --> 01:06:54,559
Go on. Go and sleep at home.

725
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:04,760
Khim.

726
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,119
Go to bed.

727
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:19,360
-Good night, Khim.
-Good night.

728
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,119
Go on. Hurry up.

729
01:07:43,239 --> 01:07:44,360
Why won't he leave?

730
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,800
I don't get you. You're so rich.

731
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,239
You're well-educated.

732
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:59,360
Why is your taste in men so weird?

733
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:01,519
Rich girls like you

734
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:03,559
don't marry guys around here.

735
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,640
What a party pooper.

736
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,079
See you in our dreams, then.

737
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:02,279
Sweet dreams.

738
01:09:05,119 --> 01:09:06,359
Sweet dreams.

739
01:09:46,199 --> 01:09:48,079
Leave my daughter alone.

740
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,920
Don't use this baby to manipulate her.

741
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,960
You can't even survive on your own.
How can you look after a woman?

742
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,720
I admit that I don't have
the resources you do.

743
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:02,159
Although I can't afford a gilded cage,
I can give her the sky.

744
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,840
You should think about it.

745
01:10:04,439 --> 01:10:08,000
Between a gilded cage and the sky,
which would a bird rather have?

746
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:11,079
Even if I had nothing but my body,
you still couldn't beat me

747
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:15,880
because you never let her be free,
so she flies back to me, the scumbag.

748
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,960
Yeah!

749
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:15,239
So we mix in the husks with our feet.

750
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,600
And we check that the husks

751
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,920
mix nicely with the mud.

752
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,199
We scatter the husks all over,
and we keep on stomping

753
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,920
so that the husks
and the mud blend into one.

754
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:04,640
-Khim?
-Yeah?

755
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,960
Will this really make
more people notice us?

756
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:07,880
Yeah.

757
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:12,000
We upload these to Facebook,
and we get people signing up.

758
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:14,119
This way, people will hear about us

759
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:16,640
not just in Thailand,
but around the world.

760
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:21,039
But how can we upload them?
We don't really have fast Internet here.

761
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:23,560
We have to go
and use the Internet at school,

762
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:26,039
or the Internet cafés in town.

763
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,680
-Really?
-Yeah.

764
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:37,720
Tell me what else I can get you
aside from the Internet.

765
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,359
Really?

766
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:43,439
I can do even better.

767
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:46,520
Gla!

768
01:12:47,439 --> 01:12:48,680
How dare you come back?

769
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,000
Khim, watch out!

770
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:54,199
Go back the way you came!

771
01:12:54,279 --> 01:12:55,439
Back off, Khim.

772
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:56,359
Hey!

773
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,119
Hey, Gla! That's enough.

774
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:00,640
Gla, come on!

775
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:12,880
Do you want to see a doctor?

776
01:13:15,279 --> 01:13:16,159
It's okay.

777
01:13:19,439 --> 01:13:20,600
Just don't let Dad know.

778
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,119
Why did they have to do that?

779
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,560
It's what happens when they hate you.

780
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,840
But don't be afraid.
They wouldn't dare come to our home.

781
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,319
Don't tell me. I know who it was.

782
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:52,640
Gla's former accuser.

783
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:59,079
Do you know about Gla's record?

784
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,800
That's why people in town are afraid
of Gla being back here.

785
01:14:08,359 --> 01:14:11,079
So what happened back then?

786
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:14,319
I've heard that it was an assault case.

787
01:14:16,439 --> 01:14:18,920
Do you think Gla and I look alike?

788
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,800
Okay, but you're wrong.

789
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,239
Gla and I have different dads.

790
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,520
Gla is from Mom's first marriage.

791
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,159
When he was younger,
Gla looked such a lot like a Westerner,

792
01:14:31,239 --> 01:14:32,479
and people teased us

793
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,880
about my dad being Gla's stepfather.

794
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:38,520
Some people were even saying
Gla was someone else's love child.

795
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:43,680
Hey, you have to practice
so you can get better.

796
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,720
You should be able to use it
with closed eyes, like it's part of you,

797
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:49,119
then you can work.

798
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:51,479
Hey!

799
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,520
What's up, daddy's little boy?

800
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,359
Ignore them. Come on, Gla.

801
01:14:58,359 --> 01:15:00,079
Going hand in hand to get a DNA test?

802
01:15:01,159 --> 01:15:02,840
Just look in the mirror.

803
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,880
Then you can tell who your mom slept with.

804
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,479
-What did you say?
-Gla, don't.

805
01:15:08,119 --> 01:15:09,199
Didn't you hear me?

806
01:15:09,279 --> 01:15:10,960
I'll say it again really clearly.

807
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:13,479
Your mom slept with an adulterer.

808
01:15:14,359 --> 01:15:15,680
Is your face a blessing,

809
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,560
or is it a curse
that betrays your mom's shamelessness?

810
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,039
-No, Gla. No!
-My family is not your business!

811
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:22,319
Out of my way!

812
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:25,399
Gla, don't.

813
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,000
Don't let me see you again.

814
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:45,000
Gla almost got that scumbag killed.

815
01:15:46,199 --> 01:15:49,319
He dared to stir up trouble
because his dad was a local politician,

816
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,239
and we leased their land to plant on,

817
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,199
so he thought he could insult us
however he liked.

818
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:58,640
Gla was charged with attempted murder

819
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:01,479
and sent straight to a juvenile hall.

820
01:16:02,119 --> 01:16:05,000
He just couldn't stand
seeing Dad get insulted like that.

821
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:06,960
Because of the incident,

822
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:08,960
they made us leave that land.

823
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:13,239
Dad sold everything we had
to pay for that guy's treatments.

824
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,439
Then we moved out here.

825
01:16:16,279 --> 01:16:19,199
Back then, Mom and Dad struggled a lot.

826
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:21,439
Mom was sick,

827
01:16:22,279 --> 01:16:23,800
but she refused to get treatment.

828
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:27,680
So Gla blamed himself
for making us go so broke.

829
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:30,920
By the time he was released,

830
01:16:32,279 --> 01:16:33,119
Mom had died.

831
01:16:34,399 --> 01:16:38,199
Mom left Gla in Dad's care
during his suspended sentence.

832
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:04,000
Why are you running off?

833
01:17:07,159 --> 01:17:09,119
You'll have no future if you drop out.

834
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:12,000
School is useless
if we stay poor like this!

835
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:16,199
You wanna be the degenerate
they say you are?

836
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:20,199
Wait and see.

837
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:22,359
I'll save our reputation.

838
01:17:22,439 --> 01:17:25,479
At least, I'll make sure
you and Mom aren't ashamed I'm yours.

839
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,640
None of us has to be stuck here, Dad.

840
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:30,720
This is not where our future ends!

841
01:17:35,399 --> 01:17:36,800
THE WELL-BEING SCHOOL

842
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,239
Dad wanted Gla to come home.

843
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:44,159
But Gla didn't want to.
Instead, he wanted to save our reputation.

844
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:47,159
So he went to Bangkok
to make money and send it home,

845
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:50,439
hoping to help Dad live
with his head held high.

846
01:18:06,039 --> 01:18:09,039
But Dad never believed
that Gla would do honest work,

847
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:12,640
so he was worried
that Gla would get thrown in prison again.

848
01:18:14,119 --> 01:18:19,239
That's why Dad has never spent
a single baht that Gla sent to us.

849
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,640
He put it all into Gla's account

850
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:24,960
because he didn't like
how Gla used money to prove himself.

851
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:29,159
Ever since, Gla has not dared to face Dad.

852
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,880
Dad wants Gla to go back to school.

853
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:36,119
But Gla thinks diplomas
and degrees aren't important.

854
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,079
He thinks that if we focus
on making lots of money,

855
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,399
no one else will look down on us again.

856
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:44,199
So he makes money
by working in that garage.

857
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,720
Dad and Gla have different perspectives.

858
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,920
But actually, both of them

859
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,159
always make sacrifices for other people.

860
01:19:00,439 --> 01:19:04,880
Dad would do anything
to protect our family.

861
01:19:05,479 --> 01:19:06,520
As for Gla,

862
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:10,000
he chose to move away from us
to build up a fortune for us.

863
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:14,840
Except for the way they look,

864
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:17,880
the two of them couldn't be more similar.

865
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:21,119
It's like Gla inherited
almost everything from Dad.

866
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,760
Especially his dedication
to his loved ones.

867
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:00,520
Khim.

868
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:08,800
I'm sorry.

869
01:20:09,479 --> 01:20:12,319
There are no parts,
so your laptop can't be repaired yet.

870
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,079
It's all right.

871
01:20:15,159 --> 01:20:17,800
While I'm here, I won't be needing it.

872
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:19,720
I'll buy you a new one.

873
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:21,960
Sure.

874
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:31,159
While you're here,

875
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,159
can you use this instead?

876
01:20:43,279 --> 01:20:45,079
Hey, this was with you?

877
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,600
You left it with me, so I kept it safe.

878
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:51,479
Thank you.

879
01:20:52,079 --> 01:20:54,920
This one is really important to me.

880
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,319
When I go somewhere I like,

881
01:20:57,399 --> 01:21:00,680
I try to capture the atmosphere
in a sketch in this book.

882
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:02,119
This book

883
01:21:02,199 --> 01:21:05,079
is like a book of all my happy thoughts.

884
01:21:05,159 --> 01:21:06,479
All the things I love

885
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:08,720
are in here.

886
01:21:10,439 --> 01:21:11,279
That's good.

887
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:14,479
I have a place for my happiness too.

888
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,319
Really? Where?

889
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:17,439
I keep it here.

890
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:20,600
And in here.

891
01:21:24,039 --> 01:21:24,880
From now on,

892
01:21:25,399 --> 01:21:28,159
you'll probably have
a lot more to put there.

893
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:31,319
From now on,
your head is going to get so huge.

894
01:21:31,399 --> 01:21:34,760
And your heart will grow really large too.

895
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:40,640
That's good.

896
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:00,159
I can't believe
we can just build a whole house ourselves.

897
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:01,520
It's so easy.

898
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,199
It saves you money,
and you don't get into debt.

899
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,720
People spend 20 or 30 years
paying off their houses.

900
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,399
They could have lived like this.

901
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:29,760
Okay, Khim.

902
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:31,439
It's a bit dusty.

903
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:32,800
So I stomp on this?

904
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,000
Yeah, step on the husks to mix everything.

905
01:22:36,199 --> 01:22:37,479
Yeah, stomp hard.

906
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:38,800
Yeah, keep stomping.

907
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:43,439
Come on. Stomp harder.

908
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,399
-Yeah. Stomp it.
-Wait a second.

909
01:22:45,479 --> 01:22:46,399
Come on.

910
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:47,640
-Here. Yeah.
-Wait!

911
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:48,840
Are you teasing me?

912
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:50,319
Stomp hard.

913
01:23:55,039 --> 01:23:56,760
Look, Khim. Push it in like this.

914
01:23:58,880 --> 01:23:59,720
All right.

915
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:01,680
Come on.

916
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,800
-Lift?
-Lift, Khim.

917
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:04,800
One, two, three.

918
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:06,520
Yeah.

919
01:24:13,399 --> 01:24:15,239
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

920
01:24:15,319 --> 01:24:16,479
It happens.

921
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,479
-That's it?
-Yeah.

922
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,840
Can I try?

923
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:20,760
Sure.

924
01:24:32,039 --> 01:24:32,920
Are you mocking me?

925
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:34,760
No.

926
01:24:36,039 --> 01:24:37,399
-You're so muddy.
-Wipe it off.

927
01:24:37,479 --> 01:24:38,880
I'm wiping. See?

928
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,239
It's everywhere.

929
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:43,600
-Wipe it properly.
-There. I'm rubbing it off.

930
01:24:45,159 --> 01:24:46,039
-Khim?
-It's gone.

931
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,039
I don't think so.

932
01:24:48,119 --> 01:24:48,960
-What?
-What?

933
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:54,680
Khim.

934
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,279
-Where are you going?
-Let go.

935
01:24:56,359 --> 01:24:59,199
-Whoa, you're making fun of me.
-Don't come any closer.

936
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:00,720
-Mocking me?
-Don't.

937
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,920
Sorry. Don't!

938
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,920
Khim! Where are you going?

939
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,520
-Mocking me, are you?
-Take that!

940
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:12,560
Mocking me?

941
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:54,319
Hey, what soap is that? It smells great.

942
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:02,479
Sit down.

943
01:26:04,279 --> 01:26:05,560
Is it vanilla?

944
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:10,439
Hey!

945
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:12,880
Now it smells like oranges.

946
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:17,279
And it's a long-lasting fragrance.

947
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:19,359
It smells delicious.

948
01:26:20,359 --> 01:26:21,640
Yeah.

949
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:22,960
-Hey!
-Whoa!

950
01:26:24,039 --> 01:26:27,800
I know what you're thinking.
Don't even think about it.

951
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:30,640
Let me wash.

952
01:26:32,359 --> 01:26:33,199
There.

953
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:36,039
This one, right?

954
01:26:42,039 --> 01:26:43,880
All right. It's your turn.

955
01:26:44,479 --> 01:26:46,359
-What?
-It's your turn.

956
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,640
Do your worst.

957
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,359
Do it. Don't be gentle. I don't mind.

958
01:26:56,279 --> 01:26:58,920
We all think of someone
when we listen to music,

959
01:26:59,439 --> 01:27:00,840
when we read books,

960
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:03,079
when we watch movies.

961
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,159
The truth is

962
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:08,760
one day, we could turn into
mere memories of the times we shared.

963
01:27:09,439 --> 01:27:10,560
Don't be so scared.

964
01:27:11,479 --> 01:27:13,439
Maximize every second of happiness.

965
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,439
From now on,
there'll be no Saikhim Kidakarn.

966
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,399
There'll be only Saikhim Chayodom.

967
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,399
I'll never love you less.

968
01:27:32,479 --> 01:27:34,239
I'll only love you more every day.

969
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,239
He fooled her
into signing a marriage certificate.

970
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:38,840
He wants to hit the jackpot.

971
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,239
-Hey, Khem!
-Gla!

972
01:27:40,319 --> 01:27:42,880
If he's arrested,
Saikhim has nowhere to go.

973
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,039
Do you want me to bring her back?

974
01:27:45,119 --> 01:27:45,960
What now, bro?

975
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,319
It's too late to get the money out.

976
01:27:48,399 --> 01:27:49,760
We need to talk, okay?

977
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:52,720
The university has received a complaint.

978
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,279
It's about your scholarship approval.

979
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:37,159
