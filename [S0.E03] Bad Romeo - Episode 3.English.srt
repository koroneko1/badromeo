1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,400
THIS FICTIONAL SERIES IS INTENDED
FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY

2
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,719
The cops accused me

3
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,199
of luring and assaulting you.

4
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,719
So you came here to harass me?

5
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,199
Hey!

6
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,199
Are you an informant?

7
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,599
I just want to say

8
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,240
that you owe me your life.

9
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,439
If I hadn't saved you,

10
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,199
you might have died by now.

11
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,680
No man would be interested in you

12
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,080
if you didn't have my fortune!

13
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,560
I think I'm pregnant.

14
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,680
What?

15
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,000
Let's end things here.

16
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,599
It's not worth it for either of us.

17
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,800
Just pretend

18
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,360
that we've never met.

19
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,960
Let's not ruin our lives more.

20
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,879
Try starting it, sir.

21
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,800
Okay.

22
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,000
All done, sir.
Call me if you need anything else.

23
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,520
-Thanks so much.
-No problem.

24
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,160
You can wait here. I won't be long.

25
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,560
This is Gaogla.

26
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,240
This is Lita.

27
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,360
Don't let them near Miss Khim.

28
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,319
Hello, I'm Annie, or the Guzheng Angel.

29
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,560
Today, I'm so delighted

30
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:29,120
because we're going to participate
in a wonderful activity here.

31
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,759
It's called Blind Date.

32
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,759
It's all about blind people
and partially-sighted people.

33
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,240
I, too, am a partially-sighted person.

34
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,920
We would like everyone here

35
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,800
to understand the feelings
and the difficulties

36
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,680
that we experience in our daily lives.

37
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,319
Did you bring it?

38
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,480
In here.

39
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,959
Ms. Lita?

40
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,040
May I help you?

41
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,959
Let's put this on.

42
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,480
-Your ID card.
-Thank you.

43
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,680
-Find your seat and put this eye mask on.
-All right.

44
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,600
Please go ahead.

45
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,079
We'd like you all
to take part in this event…

46
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,399
-That way.
-Thank you.

47
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,600
…and try living
like a visually-impaired person for a day.

48
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,079
Let's find out what it'd be like
for you all to be in the dark

49
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,279
and to walk around in the dark.

50
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,439
What good impressions
will you bring home from this event today?

51
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,360
All right.

52
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,360
Today, what we'll do is

53
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,759
try doing some shopping.

54
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,120
Have you wondered how we
visually-impaired people navigate malls?

55
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,600
Apart from walking around the mall,
today, we will also bring you…

56
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,560
Sir, your eye mask.

57
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,839
-Put it on when you sit down.
-Okay.

58
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:53,120
…buy your fruit and vegetables,
and go to eat some food.

59
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,439
The most exciting part is

60
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,480
we will go walking up the escalators.

61
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,639
Doesn't that sound exciting?

62
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,800
All right, if you're ready,

63
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,360
let's go ahead
and start doing our activities.

64
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,920
Everyone, find a partner.

65
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,079
-What?
-Go ahead, miss.

66
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,000
-Khim?
-Hey.

67
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:13,920
-Khim.
-Wait.

68
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,879
Lita.

69
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,600
Saikhim.

70
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,720
Go ahead, miss.

71
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,240
How did you know I'm a woman?

72
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,279
I can smell your perfume.

73
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,800
This way, please.

74
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,480
All right.

75
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
Good. Now, walk forward.

76
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,800
-Go ahead.
-Okay, let's begin.

77
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,120
Follow each other.

78
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,399
I can't keep up.

79
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,360
Khim? Saikhim?

80
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:58,480
-Then please wait downstairs.
-It's okay.

81
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,879
We'll catch up with you.

82
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,639
Let's go.

83
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,639
I… I'd better not risk it.

84
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,600
Don't be afraid.

85
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,279
Follow me.

86
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,439
It's not so dangerous.

87
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,639
I'll tell you when to step up.

88
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,560
Got it?

89
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,480
Up.

90
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,600
We'll make it, right?

91
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,000
We have to.

92
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,360
If we trust each other,

93
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,440
it won't be so hard.

94
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,960
Trust me with your life.

95
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,519
Take a step.

96
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,159
Take a step.

97
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,440
In our next activity,

98
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,720
we'll try putting a top
on our partner without looking.

99
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,519
People aren't always
what they appear to be.

100
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,200
If we don't look at them,

101
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,519
we won't judge them
by their outward appearance.

102
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,320
More importantly, we might even understand
who they really are much better.

103
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,240
Let's find out

104
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,480
who everyone is and learn more about them.

105
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:05,399
All right, try getting to know
the person in front of you.

106
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,720
You can touch them and ask them questions.

107
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:11,519
Try and guess
who they are and where they're from.

108
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,200
Try it out.

109
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,960
So I guess I'll go first.

110
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:28,879
Sure.

111
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,240
I think

112
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,279
you must work very hard

113
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:38,799
because

114
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,240
you have the hands
of someone who works all the time.

115
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,519
You can say they're rough.

116
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,000
I don't mind.

117
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,799
Not everyone is born rich like you.

118
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,200
Who's rich?

119
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,320
Give me your hands.

120
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,840
Your hands are soft like a rich kid's.

121
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:05,679
I guess you've never washed
any dishes in your whole life.

122
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,120
It's like you grew up in

123
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,320
Disneyland or something.

124
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,399
Disneyland?

125
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,080
I think

126
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:17,639
you're definitely single.

127
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,000
-Why?
-Well…

128
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,759
You're not wearing any rings.

129
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,200
And you have a very blunt way of speaking.

130
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:30,320
I guess you don't talk to women very much.

131
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,720
I think you'll end up single too.

132
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,039
Why?

133
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,600
Disney princesses would never dare
to drink so greedily in front of men.

134
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,600
Don't do that again anywhere.

135
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,159
-It's rude.
-Here's your order.

136
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,360
Let's figure out

137
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,960
how to eat this food
while we can't see it.

138
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,039
First, try to find your utensils.
Your knives and forks.

139
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,799
To check which is the knife
and which is the fork,

140
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:10,519
try touching one with the other.

141
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,080
Once you're sure, take the fork

142
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,440
and pierce your food,

143
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,039
then use your fork to slice your food.

144
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,159
Use your fork
to figure out what's on your plate

145
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,759
and where on the plate it is.

146
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:35,960
Is someone ill?

147
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,440
Khim, are you okay? Do you need help?

148
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,320
-Are you okay?
-I gotta go now.

149
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,480
…let's continue.

150
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,799
Khim, you have morning sickness?

151
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,159
Oh no. My symptoms are so obvious.

152
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,000
I guess I can't hide it much longer, Lita.

153
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:17,360
I've done some research.

154
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,159
Most people use this drug
to deal with the problem.

155
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,399
Maybe…

156
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,960
it will help us put an end to this.

157
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,919
Will it really end, Lita?

158
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,679
I'm being watched 24 hours a day.

159
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:42,639
I'm worried

160
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,240
that my family will suspect me.

161
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,759
Let's try something.

162
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,559
Why don't you go back
to England as a cover?

163
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,360
I can't.

164
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,200
If I went back,
Auntie Oon would have to come with me.

165
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,600
I don't think I can hide this from her.

166
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,039
There must be a way. I'll think of one.

167
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
It's okay, Khim.

168
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,919
I'll find a way to help you.

169
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,600
Hey, they're our photos from earlier.

170
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,080
But that's…

171
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,120
That guy.

172
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:39,879
Hey, did he come here just to harass you?

173
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,879
Why has he followed you everywhere?

174
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,639
What's this?

175
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:07,759
PAY MR. GAOGLA CHAYODOM FIVE MILLION BAHT

176
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,840
What's that for?

177
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,480
This is bad.

178
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,159
Hey.

179
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,000
It's that bastard.

180
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,039
Why is he here?

181
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,159
Looking for trouble?
He dared to come to my turf.

182
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,120
He will regret it.

183
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,039
For real?

184
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,600
Excuse me, we've received reports
of someone invading the ladies' room.

185
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,519
What's that got to do with me?
You can't just accuse anyone.

186
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,679
A victim reported it, sir.
May I search you, please?

187
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,600
Go ahead.

188
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,960
Hey!

189
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,400
Come in. Do you copy?

190
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,160
I've found the item on the suspect.

191
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,680
Don't make the framing so obvious.

192
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:17,680
It's that guy.

193
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
The sneaky thief.

194
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,559
Let's teach him a lesson
so that he doesn't come back.

195
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:28,640
Maybe another charge would do the trick.

196
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,079
We can't have ex-cons
strutting around here, Guard.

197
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:34,920
Remember his face.

198
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,519
With a face like that,
he should have stayed in prison.

199
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,799
-Hey!
-Hey!

200
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,720
Calm down.

201
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,039
Take him away.

202
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:46,200
Come on, sir.

203
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,839
I won't go to prison alone.

204
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,079
Will you confess

205
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,839
that you stole this gold jewelry?

206
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,480
Petty larceny like this is not much fun.

207
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:11,759
Wouldn't you rather I stole billions?

208
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
That's nonsense.

209
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:17,279
You really don't wanna know
why I was there?

210
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:23,799
If I gave you information
about counterfeit cars,

211
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,920
would you help me
reach a settlement, Officer?

212
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,599
That car was imported without paying tax.

213
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,400
They added fake Thai license plates.

214
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,759
Those rich people drive nice cars,
but they're breaking laws.

215
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,680
Each car is worth
tens of millions in taxes.

216
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
Just think about it.

217
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:47,200
How much has this gang alone stolen?

218
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,440
Maybe tens of millions.

219
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,039
You can't know someone
just by looking at them.

220
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:54,920
You have to dig deeper.

221
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,200
It's just like those fancy cars.

222
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,400
They look good on the outside.

223
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,000
But the outside is just a facade.

224
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:05,240
Maybe they're just as fake as the drivers.

225
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,440
Without legit-looking plates,

226
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,759
even the most beautiful cars are
just pieces of junk.

227
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:24,799
People are the same.

228
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:27,440
You can be born rich
and still be worthless.

229
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,200
Miss Khim, can I help you?

230
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,519
Where's Dad?

231
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,480
He went to Chiang Mai for a meeting.

232
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,799
Is it urgent, miss?

233
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,079
He'll be back tomorrow.

234
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,200
Don't worry about it.

235
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:17,839
We need to examine the car again
to see if the vehicle ID code is fake.

236
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,759
I'm just a customer.

237
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:23,240
How would I know
the dealer sold me a fake?

238
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:25,039
We need to finish examining it.

239
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,640
Then we need
another testimony, Mr. Prompat.

240
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,279
Please excuse us.

241
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,160
Let's go.

242
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,720
How could you have been so careless?
You couldn't even buy one car properly?

243
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,960
Someone must have tricked Khimhan and me.

244
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,759
Don't involve the company,

245
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:49,200
or you'll pay the price.

246
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,519
Pretend you know nothing.

247
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,759
And convince the police
that you were tricked by Khimhan.

248
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,720
Following further inquiries by the DSI,

249
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,880
dozens of luxury cars
of the rich and famous

250
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,720
have been seized for examination.

251
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,079
The investigation has targeted
imported luxury cars

252
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,880
sold by the showrooms
of Khimhan Dechachan,

253
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,680
the famous car showroom owner.

254
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:37,359
So far, the investigation has found

255
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,519
that the state has lost
a total of 300 million baht in taxes

256
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,880
thanks to 25 of the cars
in this tax evasion scam.

257
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,200
Next, the investigators
will examine luxury cars

258
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:48,480
that have been imported
via customs houses.

259
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,079
This is Saifon Tongsamud reporting.

260
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,039
Revenge on that family

261
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:57,880
turned into an inquisition
of their whole circle.

262
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
You went too far.

263
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,440
Will it come back to hurt us?

264
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,319
The cops got the cars.

265
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,119
But with no Electric Control Units,

266
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,920
they're basically rickshaws.

267
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:28,799
They wouldn't dare hurt us

268
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,480
if they knew we did their cars.

269
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,720
But if they try to hit us back,

270
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:35,279
we'll keep the ECUs.

271
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:37,960
Their cars will only ever be scrap metal.

272
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:38,880
Good, right?

273
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,000
Oops.

274
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,279
I'm sorry.

275
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,319
Don't mind me. I'm done here.

276
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,839
Prom didn't mean to cause trouble
for our family, you know?

277
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,480
Please don't take offense.

278
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:10,599
If you feel
that Prom has any room for improvement

279
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,559
and you'd like to teach him
how to be a better man,

280
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,319
I would welcome that.

281
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:20,200
Besides,

282
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,519
we are both single parents,

283
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,920
so wouldn't it be better
if we worked together to be his parents?

284
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,160
You should look after your own kids.
Khim causes enough trouble for me.

285
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:36,640
Excuse me.

286
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,359
Dad?

287
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,640
It's good that you're here.

288
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:45,759
I need to talk to you.

289
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:50,880
Oops.

290
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:52,799
Sorry, sweetie.

291
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:56,039
I didn't expect to see you here.

292
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:18,119
I'm a big girl now.

293
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,160
I would understand
if you were seeing someone.

294
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,519
You don't have to hide her from me.

295
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:26,920
I'm not a little girl.

296
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,599
You've been around the block now.

297
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,160
Nothing can shock you now.

298
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,880
Gaogla

299
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,440
has gave the check back.

300
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,960
Maybe he never planned to blackmail me.

301
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,880
You tried to buy him off.

302
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,279
You disrespected both him and me.

303
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,519
Don't you understand?

304
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:59,160
He gave the check back

305
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,079
to make himself look like a gentleman.
You still can't see that?

306
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:07,720
I'm not so boy crazy
that I can't tell right from wrong.

307
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,279
Every problem I've caused,

308
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,960
I'm ready to take responsibility
for them myself.

309
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,640
I'll never bring shame on you again.

310
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,519
I promise.

311
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,759
PAY MR. GAOGLA CHAYODOM

312
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,319
Gaogla.

313
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,680
Gaogla.

314
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,279
Auntie Oonruean?

315
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,039
It's me.

316
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:07,000
-What is it?
-I need your help with something.

317
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,599
A magazine wants to do
a photo shoot with me and Tan.

318
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,000
But Tan refuses to do it.

319
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:17,160
Can you ask him what he's so afraid of?

320
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,160
I guess Tan has his own reasons.

321
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:24,039
Are you refusing to ask him

322
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:26,799
because… you're jealous?

323
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,039
You want to keep him
as a friend with benefits?

324
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,960
Tan and I aren't dating each other.

325
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,200
So I guess if I started dating Tan,
you'd be okay with that?

326
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,400
Of course that's okay.

327
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,680
That's great to hear.

328
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,240
Now I can tell Tan not to worry about it

329
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:48,920
because you gave us your blessing.

330
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,119
Miss Khim?

331
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,200
Hello, Miss Khim?

332
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,839
Yes?

333
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:14,480
It's nice to have a heart-to-heart
as cousins once in a while, isn't it?

334
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,359
I've set the table, miss.

335
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,079
Your father is waiting.0

336
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,599
When you're the only daughter,
your dad watches you like a hawk.

337
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,599
He watches your every move.

338
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,960
You should go. Don't keep him waiting.

339
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:30,880
Yes, Auntie Oon.

340
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,839
She has spread her wings out there.

341
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,119
She won't be put back
in her gilded cage again.

342
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,279
Reset your expectations.

343
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,240
She is disobedient.

344
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:49,559
You can't call her back.

345
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:02,079
Did I keep you waiting?
Sorry I'm just a bit late.

346
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,880
I'll see a hotel group
in New York next week.

347
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,519
What about me, Uncle?

348
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:11,640
Stay here and deal with your car.

349
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:17,279
Your classes resume next month, right?

350
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,440
Is it such a good idea to have her
studying somewhere so far away?

351
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:24,960
Why do you ask?

352
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,319
She's in a Top Five university.

353
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,799
She can't throw that away.

354
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,559
But I don't want to go back yet.

355
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,880
You've been home for over a month.

356
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,480
Maybe studying is not a priority.

357
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,720
Studying is so stressful.

358
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:41,359
Maybe if you find a…

359
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,000
…that would be better.

360
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,000
She's not like you, Prim.

361
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,720
Come on, Prom.

362
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:51,359
I'm not stupid enough to debase myself
by letting any random man have me.

363
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:57,200
Return to England immediately.

364
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,640
End of discussion.

365
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:07,920
Pregnant?

366
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,519
Well, I saw the pregnancy test in her room
with my very own eyes.

367
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:15,759
Uncle Seen is too biased towards her
to see the ugly truth.

368
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:19,200
He probably doesn't know
what a degenerate she has become.

369
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:25,039
I should've embarrassed them more
so he'd stop looking down on me.

370
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,960
If she's pregnant,

371
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:30,759
how can she cope
with going back to university?

372
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,240
Mom, this isn't something
you can just hide.

373
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,799
And who can tell
if her dear old Auntie Oonruean

374
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,400
knows and is protecting her?

375
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,799
I think if she knew,
she'd help her hide it.

376
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:48,440
Maybe she'd even take advantage
of Seen's absences

377
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,559
to dispose of all the evidence.

378
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,680
We can't let all this
just go away quietly.

379
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,559
This shock could kill Uncle Seen.

380
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,359
Now his own daughter is
such a delinquent,

381
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,039
let's see if Uncle Seen
would dare to look down on me anymore.

382
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,519
Return to England immediately.

383
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:11,079
End of discussion.

384
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,519
If we trust each other,

385
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,640
it won't be so hard.

386
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,119
Trust me with your life.

387
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,799
Hey, Khem,

388
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,319
pass me the wrench.

389
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,119
I asked for the wrench,

390
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
not the screwdriver.

391
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,599
What are you doing, Khem?

392
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:33,680
When you said…

393
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,960
"If we trust each other,

394
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,720
it won't be so hard."

395
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:42,440
"Trust me with your life,"

396
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:45,000
did you mean that,

397
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,880
or was it just something cool to say?

398
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,240
I'm a man of my word. I meant what I said.

399
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,079
I gave the check back to my dad.

400
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,400
Why did you run away?
You should have stayed to talk.

401
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,000
Well, you said you wanted to end it.
You didn't want me to come see you.

402
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,519
Let's end things here.

403
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,640
It's not worth it for either of us.

404
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,960
Just pretend that we've never met.

405
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,640
Let's not ruin our lives more.

406
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:31,680
Actually,

407
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:34,599
we're virtually strangers.

408
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,359
Tie them properly, or you'll trip.

409
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:51,799
If you're going to be so nice to me,

410
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,279
I could cause more trouble for you.

411
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:07,480
Would you be mad at me

412
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,400
if I told you…

413
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,679
that I'm pregnant?

414
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,599
What?

415
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:29,159
You're pregnant?

416
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,800
Do you… do you think I'm lying?

417
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,719
No.

418
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,280
I knew it would turn out like this.

419
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:44,159
I shouldn't have told you.

420
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,440
Wait. Hey.

421
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,159
Come on. Wait.

422
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:58,880
Are you very mad at me?

423
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,960
Mad at you? For what?

424
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:03,159
I should apologize to you.

425
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:07,320
Actually, you can insult me,
or slap me, or whatever you want.

426
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,679
Come on, slap me really hard. Go on.

427
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:12,480
No.

428
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,360
It wasn't your fault.

429
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,559
I have to go back to university.

430
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,519
I can't let… this incident derail my life.

431
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,599
You mean

432
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,119
you're not keeping the baby?

433
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:54,880
If we don't do this,

434
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:58,760
my dad could kill me or you.

435
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:04,199
We'll eliminate the problem.

436
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,639
We can't let anyone else
suffer because of us.

437
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,559
This may be the only way.

438
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,519
Can you please tell me

439
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:20,920
how I should begin?

440
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,719
Begin by trusting each other,

441
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,440
and we can get through anything.

442
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,639
Are you leaving now?

443
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,320
Yeah.

444
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,760
What is it?

445
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,199
Well,

446
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:08,679
I'd like to go back to England sooner.

447
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:12,679
I thought I'd go back this weekend.

448
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,320
What happened? Didn't you want to stay?

449
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,079
While your dad's away,
you should pretend you're flying back.

450
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,960
Well… I want to get back
to continue my project.

451
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:27,880
I feel like I can't focus while I'm here.

452
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,880
Then you can run away with me.

453
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,719
I'll take you to a clinic.

454
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,039
When you feel better,
you can fly back to England.

455
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,559
Go ahead.

456
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,840
If you weren't in a hurry,

457
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,079
I'd have flown back with you.

458
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,079
Since you're already here, Auntie Oon,

459
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:23,039
I'd like you to spend as much time
with your family as possible.

460
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,519
You must have missed each other.

461
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,519
Besides, you'll have to go back to England
and stay with me for a long time.

462
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,880
I spend time with you

463
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,719
not only because it's my duty,

464
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:39,320
but also because I raised you,
so I love you in my own way.

465
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,079
When someone hurts you,

466
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,079
they hurt me even more.

467
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,480
Don't talk as if you were
a stranger to me.

468
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:49,199
You're just like one of my own children.

469
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,440
The first step is complete.

470
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,360
You look so happy using your phone.

471
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,760
Either you won the lottery,
or you found a woman.

472
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,000
You're too interested
in other people's lives.

473
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,039
Which rich person
are you getting into bed now?

474
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,480
"If you still can't tell sex from love,

475
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:36,320
you won't find
true love in this life," Gaogla.

476
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,719
If you're not careful,
you'll go to prison.

477
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:42,880
-Damn you, Khem.
-Hey, bro, relax.

478
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,639
Hey, relax, bro.

479
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,960
There's that smile.

480
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:49,280
-Khem!
-Okay, bye.

481
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,199
Please call me when you get there.

482
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:04,760
Yes, Auntie.

483
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,199
Take her to the check-in desk.

484
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,280
Yes, ma'am.

485
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,239
That's not necessary.

486
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,719
-What? Why?
-Wait. I can do it myself.

487
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,360
-Really?
-Really, Auntie.

488
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,360
My dear.

489
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,800
I have to go.

490
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,559
Remember. Don't forget to call me.

491
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:39,000
Sure.

492
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:26,480
What's wrong?

493
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,599
Is this right?

494
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,800
You came this far to hesitate now?

495
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:53,159
I feel like

496
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:56,280
I'm betraying my family.

497
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,800
I'm a brat just like my dad said I was.

498
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:08,800
If you turn back now,

499
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,559
will everything get better?

500
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:36,880
We've all made mistakes.

501
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,639
And when we behave badly,

502
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:43,719
we really want our parents
to understand us.

503
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:45,920
But each of our mistakes

504
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,519
could make us impossible to love.

505
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,519
So we can't let them know what we did

506
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,639
if we still want them to truly love us.

507
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,639
We're not running from our problem.
We're just solving it.

508
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,719
In three days,
you'll be a good girl just like before.

509
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:13,599
Once it's solved,
we never have to meet again.

510
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,239
Your future is the top priority.

511
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,519
Stay here today.

512
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:15,360
The garage is busy.
I don't want anyone to know about us.

513
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,360
The clinic will see you tomorrow.
We'll go together.

514
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,239
Are you okay on your own?

515
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,159
Should I stay?

516
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,880
See you tomorrow.

517
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,760
Why are you so scared?

518
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,159
Call me if you need help.
The garage is close by.

519
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,800
Hey, Khem.

520
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:09,519
What happened?

521
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:10,840
Someone messed with us.

522
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:13,440
Maybe it's that showroom owner.

523
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,559
He trashed the place.

524
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:17,280
He must've been after something.

525
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,639
Is anything missing?

526
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,880
Where are the ECUs?

527
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,880
Hey, don't bother.

528
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,119
Luckily, I thought ahead.
I hid them in your house already.

529
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:30,280
What? In my house?

530
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,880
Yeah. I'll go and check on them.

531
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,000
Hey, don't worry.

532
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:35,679
I'll check on them.

533
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:37,119
You clean up here.

534
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:42,719
SAIKHIM

535
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:45,400
What is it?

536
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,280
What?

537
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,159
It was like this when I got here.

538
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,800
Were you burgled?

539
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,320
What are those?

540
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,360
What's in there?

541
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,679
What they wanted to steal.

542
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,679
You troublemaker.

543
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:41,280
You had the nerve to snitch to the cops
while you took money from my peers and me.

544
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:44,239
You shouldn't have flown
so close to the sun.

545
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,280
You even ran off with Saikhim.

546
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,239
-What do you mean?
-Saikhim isn't on the plane.

547
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,000
You deceived my cousin.

548
00:46:56,599 --> 00:46:58,280
You thought you'd outsmart me?

549
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,639
You took my cousin
so that you could get rich faster, right?

550
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:04,159
What do you want?

551
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:05,880
Give me back my car's ECU,

552
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:09,760
or I'll tell my uncle
that Sakhim ran off with you.

553
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,519
Hey, or maybe you do want me to tell him.

554
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,679
You are marrying
into our rich family anyway.

555
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,480
When do you want it?

556
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:19,679
By the end of the day.

557
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,079
An ECU for a billion-baht heiress.

558
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:24,199
Totally worth it, right?

559
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,360
Take your ECU back

560
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,920
and don't snitch.

561
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:31,679
With a scandal like this,

562
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:35,599
even if I said nothing,
you'd still get caught one day.

563
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,920
I don't understand what she sees in you.

564
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,119
Why is Saikhim so into you?

565
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,960
See you tonight, and do keep your promise.

566
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,199
What's happening?

567
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,440
Don't ask now.

568
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:53,559
You can't stay here today.
Take your stuff and go now.

569
00:47:56,199 --> 00:47:57,039
Come on.

570
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:08,199
-Where are we going?
-It's not safe here.

571
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:13,760
What's in that bag?

572
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:19,400
The tools of my profession.

573
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,760
Don't ask now. Let's go.

574
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,960
I'm not going.

575
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,960
What exactly is your job?

576
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,559
You're not an auto mechanic?

577
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,360
How is that relevant?

578
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,320
Well, you've been in prison, right?

579
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,840
What's happening,

580
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,119
is it connected to that?

581
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:39,880
I'm not going to kill you.

582
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,360
I just want to know
how much I can trust you.

583
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,840
Why are you paranoid now?

584
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,800
Well, I don't know who you really are.
You're good one minute and bad the next.

585
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,239
That doesn't matter.

586
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,960
At least I wouldn't kill my unborn child.

587
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,320
I just meant

588
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,320
that I'm not a murderer or whatever.

589
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,039
So you… aren't helping me willingly.

590
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:11,639
Let's just go.

591
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,360
Or you can wait for your cousin
to pick you up here.

592
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:21,280
He knows we're together.
Luckily, though he knows we ran away,

593
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,960
he doesn't know about our baby.

594
00:49:25,159 --> 00:49:26,480
So I'm playing for time.

595
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,480
We'll deal with the kid,
then you'll have a clean slate again.

596
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:33,559
Come on.

597
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,599
Khim?

598
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,840
What's going on?

599
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:08,800
You abducted her, did you?

600
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:12,000
Lita.

601
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:15,599
I lied to my family,
and we ran off together.

602
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,519
What?

603
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,639
We're solving the problem.

604
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:22,159
So now you're a gentleman?

605
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:24,280
He promised

606
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,719
to help me solve the problem with the baby

607
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,199
while Dad's overseas.

608
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:31,760
Can I leave Khim with you for now?

609
00:50:32,679 --> 00:50:33,519
Of course.

610
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:35,760
Who'd leave her with you, sex addict?

611
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,800
Khim.

612
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:43,800
But if you stay here,

613
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,360
your dad will find you

614
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,960
because his foundation knows
that I'm living here.

615
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:05,000
Ms. Ji-Yeon!

616
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:08,239
-Hello.
-Hello.

617
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,159
Come here.

618
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:11,760
-So cute. Mom?
-Yeah?

619
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,719
Can my friend stay tonight?

620
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:20,000
Hey, you have normal friends like these?

621
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,800
Mom, what did you expect?

622
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,320
Your friend is so pretty.

623
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:25,960
Hey, she's absolutely gorgeous.

624
00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:27,480
Please come in.

625
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:29,440
Come on, you can come in.

626
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:33,880
Sweetie, you're like a doll.

627
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:49,159
All right. My mom is renting this house.
They won't look for you here.

628
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,280
Well?

629
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,760
Go on.

630
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,760
Are you sure he's not your boyfriend?

631
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,719
Mom! What a silly question.

632
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,840
Look at his face. I can't stand it.

633
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,800
Isn't he the one

634
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,239
who stares at your boobs
while you're talking?

635
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,679
-Mom!
-What did I say?

636
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,119
Hush.

637
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,800
Stop talking. Don't.

638
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,360
Mom!

639
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:32,199
What a nice body.
You've been so helpful with her bags.

640
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,840
Hey, serious question.
Do you have feelings for Lita?

641
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,760
Mom!

642
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:38,960
Stop matchmaking. Do you even know him?

643
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,599
Do you know his family?

644
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,760
No, I don't know.
I do know that he drove you girls here.

645
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,880
He didn't let you come alone
so late at night.

646
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,920
Well, that sounds like a gent to me.

647
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:51,159
He's treating you so nicely.

648
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:54,039
If he didn't like you,
he wouldn't drive you home.

649
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,920
So tell me,

650
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,320
are you single?

651
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,679
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yeah, right. He already has a kid.

652
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:10,599
Well, you don't waste time either, do you?

653
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:12,880
I'm a single parent of an only child too.

654
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,239
Well, it's not so bad, is it?

655
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:24,760
Hey.

656
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,639
Do you really want
to help Khim with her problem?

657
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,360
If I didn't, would I do all this?

658
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,119
Are you still being so nice

659
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:38,800
so that you can pursue her
until she falls for you?

660
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:42,119
I warn you, my friend is not easy.

661
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:46,119
Don't use the baby
as an excuse to make her stay with you.

662
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:47,840
Make her stay?

663
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,119
You got her pregnant,

664
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,760
but that doesn't mean you own her.

665
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,360
What century are we in?

666
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,039
Don't use the baby
to bring her down to your level.

667
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:01,920
If I hadn't been careless,

668
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,159
you'd never have slept with her.

669
00:54:05,719 --> 00:54:06,920
Remember this.

670
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,599
Never dare to touch
this forbidden fruit, ever.

671
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,119
I know.

672
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:15,079
I'm just paying for my sins

673
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,599
for this life

674
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:19,119
and for the next one as well.

675
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:22,400
Start counting down. It won't be long now.

676
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:48,800
So we're even.

677
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:51,480
I get my stuff back. You get my cousin.

678
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,920
No one must know about this.

679
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,559
You're not much of a gangster.

680
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,519
Own your mistakes, won't you?

681
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:01,039
In just a few days, Saikhim will go home.

682
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,559
Used cars depreciate.

683
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:06,440
She's a used person.
How damaged will she be?

684
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:08,639
Who knows if my uncle

685
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:10,519
will still want his daughter back?

686
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:14,679
If you don't keep your promise,
another charge might come your way.

687
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:17,639
Even if I say nothing,

688
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:19,559
it doesn't mean he won't know.

689
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,280
You watch yourself too.

690
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,960
My uncle won't let you get away with it.

691
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:53,599
So this is all for that girl?

692
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:55,800
You sabotaged your career,

693
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,400
and you could go to prison.

694
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,880
How much more
will this woman ruin your life?

695
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,159
Khem.

696
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,719
I wonder where Miss Khim is now.

697
00:56:33,639 --> 00:56:36,480
I've asked a friend
who works with the airline to check.

698
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,440
They said Khim never got on the flight.

699
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,760
They asked Immigration, and they said

700
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,239
that she's in still Thailand.

701
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:44,239
Is it possible

702
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,000
that Saikhim ran off with her lover?

703
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:51,000
When Prom found out,
he tried looking for more answers.

704
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:53,559
So what should we do now?

705
00:56:53,639 --> 00:56:58,360
This must mean
that Khim really loves this person.

706
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,039
That's why she lied to us over and over.

707
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,119
My goodness, Khim.

708
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:05,559
She shouldn't care about him
more than about her dad.

709
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:08,599
I didn't know
whether I should tell everyone this.

710
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,280
Earlier,

711
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:14,480
I… happened to see that Khim had bought
a pregnancy test for herself.

712
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,039
I don't know if that was related to this.

713
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,199
I think

714
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,119
we should wait for updates from Prom.

715
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:41,400
I hope Uncle won't forgive Khim this time.

716
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:46,760
If they're already having a baby together,
I doubt Seen could cope with that.

717
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,519
He loves her and wants to protect her
more than he does anything else.

718
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:54,280
Since Saikhim is a reminder
that Rarin left behind,

719
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,719
Seen probably won't be able to bear it

720
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,239
if he lost another person he loved.

721
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:04,079
Well, Auntie Rarin has been dead
for ten years already.

722
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,719
Why isn't he over her yet?

723
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:09,480
Well, she didn't die of natural causes.

724
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:10,800
She killed herself.

725
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,079
-What?
-What? She killed herself, Mom?

726
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,760
I thought she…

727
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:17,760
she was ill.

728
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,440
Back then, you two were little.

729
00:58:22,519 --> 00:58:24,800
No one wanted you to know about it.

730
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:28,519
Saikhim's mother was obsessed
with a photographer.

731
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:30,480
She had him take nude photos of her.

732
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:31,719
When they were leaked,

733
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,679
the scandal lasted for some time.

734
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,719
That's why Seen couldn't deal with it,
and they never reconciled.

735
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,079
Rarin ended her life
to run away from the problem.

736
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:43,760
I thought it was just an ordinary affair.

737
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,920
I never thought it was that toxic.
It's no wonder.

738
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,440
That's why he's not over it.

739
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:50,119
That's why he's overprotective.

740
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,760
Seen can't stand betrayal.

741
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,719
Since it happened,
he refused to let Rarin touch Saikhim.

742
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,800
Rarin felt so hurt
that she overdosed on pills.

743
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,880
When Saikhim ran away with her lover,

744
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,519
Seen felt she was slipping away from him.

745
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:10,719
He couldn't stand seeing her

746
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,679
loving someone else rather than him.

747
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:17,599
If Khim knew about this,
she wouldn't dare come home to face him.

748
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,440
She was stupid to get fooled.
She brought this on herself.

749
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,960
Maybe this scandal

750
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:28,840
could rip this father and daughter apart
once and for all.

751
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,719
It must break his heart

752
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:33,880
to see her run off with a man.

753
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,639
Uncle Seen is unlucky.

754
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:40,079
The women in his life are all degenerates.

755
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:44,119
Well, who could stand
such a heartless person?

756
00:59:45,079 --> 00:59:45,920
This is great.

757
00:59:47,079 --> 00:59:49,559
Now he'll see the good in you,
Prim and Prom.

758
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:56,840
I was just tidying Miss Khim's room.

759
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,480
I never knew that Miss Khim

760
00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:01,400
was hiding these things.

761
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:04,599
It's been over a month since that day.

762
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:06,760
I'm so worried.

763
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:07,679
I'm afraid…

764
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:13,599
This scumbag wants to use this kid
to manipulate Saikhim.

765
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:16,960
And if it turns out to be true,
what should we do?

766
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,199
Why are you paranoid now?

767
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:41,159
Well, I don't know who you really are.
You're good one minute and bad the next.

768
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:42,599
That doesn't matter.

769
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,559
At least I wouldn't kill my unborn child.

770
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:34,599
You got her pregnant,
but that doesn't mean you own her.

771
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:36,360
What century are we in?

772
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,079
Don't use the baby
to bring her down to your level.

773
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:41,800
If I hadn't been careless,

774
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,800
you'd never have slept with her.

775
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:46,599
Remember this.

776
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,360
Never dare to touch
this forbidden fruit, ever.

777
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,679
No matter how much
I want to take care of you and the baby,

778
01:01:55,239 --> 01:01:59,199
I guess I'm too worthless
for you to throw your life away for.

779
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:00,920
Right?

780
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:41,360
SAJEE'S HAIR AND BEAUTY SALON

781
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,480
That feels so nice, Mom.

782
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:22,519
It feels so nice, doesn't it?

783
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:25,039
Now I understand why men fall for you.

784
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,039
You have the hands of an angel.
You can slay evil spirits.

785
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,400
I don't have to worry about you.

786
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:34,840
Actually, I have some other special moves.

787
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:35,840
Like what, Mom?

788
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,159
I don't like where this song is going.

789
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:47,239
No. Enough. Please stop.

790
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,360
-So much fun.
-Hey, Mom.

791
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,960
-What?
-My friend is up.

792
01:04:30,039 --> 01:04:32,840
You're awake, dear? Are you hungry?

793
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,760
I'll make you some breakfast.

794
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,199
How about you?

795
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,599
-I'm hungry.
-You're hungry?

796
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:38,960
I'll do the best I can.

797
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:40,480
Hey, tell me what you want.

798
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:41,760
-You're the best.
-Tell me.

799
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:47,679
Let's take a shower and brush our teeth.

800
01:04:48,199 --> 01:04:49,119
So having a mom

801
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:52,000
is nice like this.

802
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:56,239
When a student has a baby,
they grow up together like this.

803
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,119
She's a former teen mom.

804
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:09,039
If my mom had been
a deep thinker like you,

805
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,079
I wouldn't be here.

806
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:13,400
She didn't think hard enough,
so now you're all stuck with me.

807
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:42,760
My goodness.

808
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,360
I thought you'd flake out.

809
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,400
I'm not holding on.

810
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:49,480
Hey, did you actually sleep in your car
to watch over Saikhim?

811
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,519
Is Khim awake?

812
01:05:53,559 --> 01:05:54,400
Yeah.

813
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:05,280
What are you doing?

814
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,519
You took the pill?

815
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:10,880
Did you? What did you take?

816
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:11,840
Spit it out.

817
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,599
Come on, spit it out.

818
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,119
What are you doing?

819
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,320
It's candy?

820
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,800
Of course it is.

821
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,840
I didn't know. I thought
you got impatient and took that pill.

822
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,119
I'm sorry.

823
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:17,199
I didn't mean it.

824
01:07:18,199 --> 01:07:19,480
You didn't mean it?

825
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:22,239
But you kissed Khim so deeply.

826
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,199
-Khim?
-Khim?

827
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,119
Hey.

828
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:32,320
Where did that kiss come from?

829
01:07:35,079 --> 01:07:37,159
-Khim. Hey!
-Stop, you psycho!

830
01:07:37,239 --> 01:07:38,159
-Hey!
-Get out!

831
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:39,159
-Khim!
-Get out!

832
01:07:39,239 --> 01:07:41,239
-My goodness. Do this.
-Mom, it's too short.

833
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,519
-Hey!
-Yeah!

834
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:43,679
Mom, go all out.

835
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:44,639
-Get out!
-Yeah!

836
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:58,800
This is crazy.

837
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,840
How dare he do that?

838
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,119
He should have asked.

839
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:29,359
What have I done?

840
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,399
Damn it.

841
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,840
For goodness' sake.

842
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,079
How can I face her now?

843
01:08:55,119 --> 01:08:56,319
LITA

844
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,840
Who are you,
and what right have you to invade my home?

845
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,439
Just go away right now.

846
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,279
GAOGLA

847
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:10,760
I'm looking for Miss Saikhim.

848
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,359
Saikhim?

849
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:14,880
Why would she be here?

850
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,960
Miss Khim ran away from home yesterday.

851
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:19,319
May we search your property?

852
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:23,600
You may not!

853
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:27,399
We both told you that she's not here,
so you've no right to search here.

854
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:29,119
Her father's very worried about her.

855
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:31,159
If there's evidence
that she contacted you,

856
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,760
it could make it easier
for us to find her.

857
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:36,880
How could the two of us
know where Saikhim went?

858
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,279
If you search our home,

859
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:43,840
and you damage our possessions,
you have to take care of the damages.

860
01:09:55,479 --> 01:09:56,439
Where is Saikhim?

861
01:09:58,159 --> 01:09:59,199
How should I know?

862
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:01,359
I know you took her away with you.

863
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,880
Can you afford to keep her happy?

864
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,760
Is that why you took her from me?

865
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:07,520
Let me ask you this.

866
01:10:08,119 --> 01:10:10,920
If you made her so happy,
why would she run from you?

867
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,479
Leave my daughter alone.

868
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,800
Don't use this baby to manipulate her.

869
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,199
You can't even survive on your own.

870
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:21,199
How can you look after a woman?

871
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:25,319
I admit that I don't have
the resources you do.

872
01:10:25,399 --> 01:10:27,720
Although I can't afford a gilded cage,

873
01:10:28,359 --> 01:10:29,760
I can give her the sky.

874
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,399
You should think about it.

875
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,600
Between a gilded cage and the sky,
which would a bird rather have?

876
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,600
Even if I had nothing but my body,
you still couldn't beat me

877
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,680
because you never let her be free,

878
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,680
so she flies back to me, the scumbag.

879
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,159
Call the cops, honey. Call them.

880
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,359
Hey!

881
01:11:00,439 --> 01:11:02,399
-Hey!
-You can't go up there, sir!

882
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:03,399
Don't go there.

883
01:11:04,199 --> 01:11:05,520
-No one's there.
-Get out now!

884
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:06,720
You can't go up there.

885
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,640
You can't go there without permission.

886
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:12,640
That's so rude. It's my home.
I told you you can't do this!

887
01:11:13,319 --> 01:11:14,159
Don't open it!

888
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,439
You're not allowed to open it!

889
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:42,520
-Don't open it, sir!
-Don't!

890
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,000
Close it now.

891
01:11:56,119 --> 01:11:59,399
See? There's nothing there.
Only panties hung out to dry. Your loss.

892
01:11:59,479 --> 01:12:00,560
-Satisfied?
-Yeah.

893
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,359
-We said there was nothing.
-Yeah.

894
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:12,039
-Hey, we said there was nothing up there!
-We said there was nothing there!

895
01:12:16,439 --> 01:12:18,399
-Mr. Sansern!
-There's nothing up there.

896
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:19,359
Don't go inside.

897
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:21,680
It's our home.
You don't have our permission.

898
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:24,319
How dare you? Who do you think you are?

899
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:26,159
How dare you disrespect the law?

900
01:12:33,319 --> 01:12:36,520
If Miss Saikhim isn't here,
you don't need to worry.

901
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:40,239
If you really are her friends,
you should cooperate

902
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:42,000
so I can find her sooner.

903
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,279
Such a rude attitude.

904
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:48,479
No wonder she can't stand you.
It's good that she ran away.

905
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:50,800
Mr. Sansern!

906
01:13:06,359 --> 01:13:07,199
Gaogla.

907
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:13,479
Get back inside!

908
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,199
Someone's there.

909
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:18,640
Stay still!

910
01:13:27,079 --> 01:13:28,479
See? There's nothing there.

911
01:13:34,359 --> 01:13:35,439
Mr. Sansern.

912
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,800
We told you there was nothing there.

913
01:13:52,279 --> 01:13:53,760
See? For goodness' sake.

914
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:57,119
So much walking around for nothing.
We told you there was nothing.

915
01:14:03,479 --> 01:14:05,680
-There's nothing there.
-They're still searching.

916
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,279
-You searched already.
-We said there was nothing!

917
01:14:08,359 --> 01:14:10,279
-You searched there already.
-Yeah.

918
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:12,520
Stay still, okay?

919
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:19,119
Hand me the bag.

920
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,159
We said there was nothing.
Why won't you believe us? Damn.

921
01:14:44,119 --> 01:14:45,520
Has Gaogla been in contact?

922
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:46,520
Gaogla?

923
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,479
Who's that?

924
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,840
He tricked Miss Khim into running away.

925
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,319
This is the second time.

926
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:01,399
So you know they ran off together.
But why are you searching here?

927
01:15:01,479 --> 01:15:03,159
Your daughter may have helped them.

928
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,159
Such strange ideas

929
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:07,920
tend to come from your daughter.

930
01:15:09,119 --> 01:15:09,960
Really?

931
01:15:12,359 --> 01:15:15,439
But I really have no idea this time, Mom.

932
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,359
I swear.

933
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,560
Stay calm. Don't be afraid.

934
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:27,800
Carefully take a step.

935
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:31,520
Give me your hand.

936
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:38,960
Look over here.

937
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:46,560
Move slowly.

938
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:51,199
Count to three, then take a step.

939
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:56,680
One. Two. Three.

940
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:10,760
We're done. There's nothing there.

941
01:16:14,479 --> 01:16:15,640
-Told you.
-Unbelievable.

942
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:16,760
And these clothes?

943
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:19,279
We didn't find those.

944
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:24,239
Mom, we've had no clients yet today.

945
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:26,119
That's awful. In that case,

946
01:16:26,199 --> 01:16:29,600
since you kept my clients away,
why don't you try a facial massage?

947
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,640
-Would you like a facial massage?
-No.

948
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,520
-Where are my clients? Take this.
-That's enough.

949
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,520
-Take this.
-Hey. Wait.

950
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,439
That's enough.

951
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:45,800
Here you go.
Compensation for reduced foot traffic.

952
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:48,239
If you hear of those two, call me.

953
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:49,680
That's all?

954
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:50,600
You don't want it?

955
01:16:51,479 --> 01:16:54,520
Hey, wait. I'll take it. Jeez.

956
01:16:55,079 --> 01:16:57,920
All right, who wants a facial massage?

957
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,039
Another facial massage?
Yes? Facial massage?

958
01:17:01,119 --> 01:17:02,399
Thanks for your business.

959
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:06,640
That was close.

960
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:10,920
Gently.

961
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:12,479
Are you okay?

962
01:17:16,279 --> 01:17:19,399
If you want to trust me with your life,
we must trust each other.

963
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,159
Then we'll both survive.

964
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:27,760
All three of us.

965
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,039
It'll survive, right?

966
01:17:49,359 --> 01:17:50,319
That's up to you

967
01:17:51,279 --> 01:17:52,600
whether it stays or goes.

968
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,239
But with me, it will be safe.

969
01:17:58,119 --> 01:17:59,079
Are you sure?

970
01:17:59,159 --> 01:18:00,039
Of course.

971
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:05,720
I got killed at sea, but I'm still alive.

972
01:18:07,159 --> 01:18:09,119
-Come on.
-Don't be silly.

973
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,640
Actually, I'm helping you
avoid getting arrested.

974
01:18:24,439 --> 01:18:27,159
If I'd died that day,
where would you be today?

975
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:31,479
Well, I guess

976
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:34,279
I'd be hanging over there,

977
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:35,640
or maybe

978
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:37,920
lying still down there.

979
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,479
If all three of us survive,

980
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,279
can I ask you something?

981
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:47,760
What is it?

982
01:18:50,119 --> 01:18:50,960
I'd ilke…

983
01:18:52,359 --> 01:18:53,680
Hey!

984
01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,399
Hey!

985
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:04,000
Are you okay?

986
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:08,760
Is it okay?

987
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:15,960
Watch out!

988
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:27,279
The doctor says the X-ray results are in,
and the patient is safe.

989
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:29,760
There are only cuts and bruises.

990
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,119
We'll treat the wounds,
then he can go home.

991
01:19:32,199 --> 01:19:33,039
Thank you.

992
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,560
Since we met,

993
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,479
I've gotten you hurt so many times.

994
01:19:53,479 --> 01:19:54,880
I've ruined your life too.

995
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,760
Your dad must know about the baby by now.

996
01:20:01,359 --> 01:20:04,159
It's time to go to the clinic.
We should go now.

997
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,119
It managed to survive.

998
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:11,720
We can't kill it now.

999
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:20,960
It's not just the baby's life.
Your life is important too.

1000
01:20:21,479 --> 01:20:25,680
I'm worried about your future too.
As for me, I have nothing to lose.

1001
01:20:28,119 --> 01:20:29,399
Just before our accident,

1002
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,319
you wanted to ask me something.

1003
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:38,079
If all three of us survive,

1004
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:39,840
can I ask you something?

1005
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,359
What is it?

1006
01:20:47,279 --> 01:20:48,560
What did you want to ask?

1007
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,279
How can I repay you?

1008
01:20:57,119 --> 01:20:59,039
I'd like you to give me sole custody.

1009
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,159
I can handle one kid.

1010
01:21:07,239 --> 01:21:08,640
But I know it's impossible.

1011
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,720
Ruining your life to have the baby

1012
01:21:13,359 --> 01:21:14,359
is too much to ask.

1013
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:17,880
Eight or nine months

1014
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,399
aren't worth the sacrifice, right?

1015
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,199
But with me, it will be safe.

1016
01:21:59,439 --> 01:22:00,359
Is it okay?

1017
01:22:01,079 --> 01:22:02,199
Watch out!

1018
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:38,800
Come on.

1019
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:44,840
Wait.

1020
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:55,000
Could you… show me…

1021
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,720
how you'll raise it?

1022
01:23:01,479 --> 01:23:02,960
If you can cope with raising it,

1023
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,239
I'll give you sole custody.

1024
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:10,800
Are you sure you'll keep the baby?

1025
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:14,039
Honestly, I think this guy is useless.

1026
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,279
Shouldn't we regroup here
and figure it out together?

1027
01:23:21,119 --> 01:23:26,079
Thanks for caring about me, Lita.
But I can take care of myself.

1028
01:23:27,399 --> 01:23:28,239
Khim.

1029
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,680
Your life isn't over yet.

1030
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:35,279
Come back, and we'll figure it out.
We might find a better solution.

1031
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:39,840
We can't go back and fix things anyway.

1032
01:23:40,439 --> 01:23:44,000
I'd rather move forward
even if there's an abyss in front of me.

1033
01:24:41,079 --> 01:24:42,800
I never thought a rich kid like her

1034
01:24:43,319 --> 01:24:45,960
would agree to try her luck
with me when I've no future.

1035
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,479
No matter how smart you are,
anyone can make mistakes.

1036
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,479
I admit that I messed up
because of something stupid.

1037
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:36,640
You asked me how I would raise the kid.

1038
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:38,399
This is how.

1039
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,720
I'll raise it where I grew up.

1040
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:49,760
Don't worry. It won't turn out like me.

1041
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:55,640
I promise, I can take good care of it.

1042
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:59,479
I'll show the kid
how lucky we all are to be alive.

1043
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:01,520
At least it will have an awesome life.

1044
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:04,279
It will be a life worth living.

1045
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:13,800
And it won't starve
like when it's with you.

1046
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:20,800
No. Actually, I'm not that hungry.

1047
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:23,600
Stop acting tough.

1048
01:27:24,399 --> 01:27:26,479
We've come too far to be embarrassed now.

1049
01:27:34,439 --> 01:27:36,159
You act like we're strangers.

1050
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,800
Since when have we been close friends?

1051
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:43,720
You're so closed off.

1052
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:46,920
We're distant friends.

1053
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:49,960
Am I distant enough now?

1054
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:51,720
Distant enough for you?

1055
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:53,359
How about now?

1056
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,279
Because of her,
I want to be a good person again.

1057
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:20,680
I think Gaogla is using that kid
to manipulate Khim

1058
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:22,159
to defy us, actually, Uncle.

1059
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:23,199
Did you abduct her?

1060
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:24,680
Who do you think I am, Dad?

1061
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:26,359
You're hotheaded and impatient.

1062
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:29,239
You good-for-nothing.
What have you ever done right?

1063
01:28:29,319 --> 01:28:31,079
-What are you doing here?
-Dad, enough.

1064
01:28:31,159 --> 01:28:32,159
-Dad!
-You…

1065
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:34,000
What are you doing here?

1066
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:36,720
You see what happens
when you let emotions run your life?

1067
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:39,399
So what do you think?

1068
01:28:40,199 --> 01:28:41,680
Would you live here with me?

1069
01:28:42,439 --> 01:28:44,079
Who would I be to you here?

1070
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:45,279
Why are you so scared?

1071
01:28:48,479 --> 01:28:49,359
Don't.

1072
01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:52,720
I'll take responsibility
for the damage to your daughter's life.

1073
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:53,840
If you don't mind,

1074
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:56,039
my son wants to marry Saikhim.

1075
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:58,159
Gla!

1076
01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:34,159
