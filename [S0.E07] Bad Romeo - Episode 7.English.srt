00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,400
THIS FICTIONAL SERIES IS INTENDED
FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY

2
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,639
Your life is worth more than that car.

3
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,159
Don't let anyone make you feel worthless.

4
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,159
Watch Saikhim closely.

5
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,199
Don't let her contact such men again.

6
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,240
I think I'm pregnant.

7
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,520
Why is this happening to me?

8
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,360
Even if I had nothing but my body,
you still couldn't beat me

9
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,199
because you never let her be free,

10
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,400
so she flies back to me, the scumbag.

11
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,319
If you don't mind,

12
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,879
my son wants to marry Saikhim.

13
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,719
You think your son is a match
for my daughter?

14
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,319
Even if he died and were reborn,
I doubt he'd be enough.

15
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,080
-Would you live here with me?
-Who would I be to you here?

16
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,560
You'd be my lady.

17
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,719
If he's arrested,

18
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,280
Saikhim has nowhere to go.

19
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,840
Am I bad enough for you now?

20
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:24,400
My only mistake was falling
for a woman like you!

21
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,800
LOVE… HAS TURNED INTO HATE

22
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,360
SEVEN YEARS LATER

23
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,000
We've found the island's owner.

24
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,879
I'm heading there now.

25
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,800
They can offer a price first.

26
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:38,719
PHUKET

27
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,080
Please prepare a rough appraisal.

28
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,879
I'll use it in the negotiation. Thank you.

29
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,319
This way, Miss Saikhim.

30
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,600
What are you doing?

31
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,399
Sending a lantern to my dad in heaven.

32
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,240
I see. This lantern can fly that far?

33
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:44,199
When I miss my dad,
I release lanterns here.

34
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,920
Whatever wish I make,
it always comes true.

35
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,839
Your dad must be so proud of you.

36
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,879
Do you know someone in heaven, miss?

37
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,680
You can send them a letter.

38
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,399
I don't know if he's still up there.

39
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,319
It's been seven years.

40
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,560
Miracles do happen, miss.

41
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,160
THE CAR IS READY

42
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,800
Is it much farther?

43
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,079
We're not halfway yet, miss.
It's odd to build a house on this island.

44
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Oh, great.

45
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,759
What now?

46
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,879
What happened?

47
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:03,399
The gas might be leaking.
I guess I'll go get some more.

48
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm not sure if they have any.

49
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,720
In that case, I'll go on alone.

50
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Please take care of the car
and pick me up when it's ready.

51
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:16,879
I'll be at that house.

52
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,879
Sure, miss.

53
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,720
-Thank you.
-Sure.

54
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,560
Excuse me.

55
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,360
How far
from here is the island owner's house?

56
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,199
Excuse me.

57
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,720
Gla.

58
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,160
Please excuse me. I must be seeing things.

59
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,279
Why do you look like someone I once knew?

60
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,480
Someone you knew?

61
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:21,839
Just like him.

62
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,759
Really?

63
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,480
The world isn't that small.

64
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,600
He's dead.

65
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,360
You do look like you've seen a ghost.

66
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,799
I'm sorry, you see,
I'm looking for the island's owner.

67
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,440
Do you know them?

68
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,840
I heard they own
a holiday home on this island.

69
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,559
Everyone knows them.

70
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,240
Could you please take me to them?

71
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,720
Please take this for your trouble.

72
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:14,960
Thank you so much.

73
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,080
Are you sure this is it?

74
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,120
Hello.

75
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,759
Is anyone there?

76
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,159
Hello.

77
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,879
Is anyone there?

78
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,759
I've reached their house,
but I haven't seen them.

79
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:17,320
It seems an odd home.

80
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,000
I didn't expect them to live here.

81
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,720
Pick me up here.

82
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,200
Wait, mister.

83
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,840
The island owner isn't here.
How can I reach them?

84
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,240
You'll know when you see 'em.

85
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,840
Wait.

86
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,039
1,000

87
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,679
Thanks.

88
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,840
When the astrologer said
our destinies were incompatible,

89
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,480
I got so anxious.

90
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,399
My element is earth.

91
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,480
But these colors

92
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:27,000
are inauspicious for me.

93
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,200
If we could just add some red,

94
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,000
it would enhance my confidence.

95
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,960
I want some bold colors
for that expensive look.

96
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,960
Could you please modify the palette?

97
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,000
Okay, I'll update the design.

98
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,360
I'm sorry to make you update it again.

99
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,879
It's only a small tweak, right?

100
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,440
Certainly. We do our best for our clients.

101
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,440
Thank you so much.

102
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,080
KHIM

103
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:57,320
Why so many design updates?
This is like the millionth time.

104
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,039
Which grandpa or auntie
told them to do this?

105
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,519
I've made and burnt down
almost a hundred models now.

106
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,039
They know that I design houses, right?
I can't fix their destinies.

107
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,200
Aren't you used to it?

108
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,240
No, not yet.

109
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,440
Come on. You're amazing, Lita.

110
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,840
This will be easy for you.

111
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,039
Yeah, of course.

112
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,679
So did you call me
to talk about something specific?

113
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:21,879
I'm doing some business in Phuket.

114
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,399
Something odd happened.

115
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,279
I saw Gla here.

116
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,159
Gla who?

117
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,480
Wait. Do you mean that guy?

118
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,879
He's so much like him.

119
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,679
Even his voice is like his.
I thought it was him.

120
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,559
But he died long ago, Khim.

121
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,519
Well, exactly. That's why I'm wondering.

122
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,440
How can someone look so much like him?

123
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,799
The only thing missing is his tattoo.

124
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:48,720
Maybe he's his twin
or some other family member?

125
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,679
Gla only had a little sister.

126
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:55,799
So did he recognize you?

127
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:56,720
No.

128
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:58,679
He didn't know me at all.

129
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,159
So don't worry about it.
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

130
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:05,639
So are we going to fly
to Hong Kong together tonight?

131
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,320
I guess I'll be late.
I might have to get on a later flight.

132
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,720
But I'll be there tomorrow before noon.

133
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,120
Tell Tan for me, Lita.

134
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,440
Hey! This is a huge event.
Don't you dare miss it.

135
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,799
Hello? Khim?

136
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,159
What?

137
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,799
I brought your boss to the island's owner.

138
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:01,440
She said you can just leave.
They'll take a helicopter to the airport.

139
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,360
Nobody turned up.
I guess we missed each other.

140
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:40,720
Can I leave a letter and my business card
for the island owner?

141
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,960
Your driver is at the beach.
Get in the car. I'll drive you there.

142
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,000
Come on.

143
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,360
Are you from here?
Have you been here long?

144
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,279
No.

145
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:12,440
What are you doing here?
Did the owner of the island hire you?

146
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,159
Has anyone ever tried to buy this island?

147
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,440
No one.

148
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,679
Really? You think the owner would sell it?

149
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:35,840
Fifty million.

150
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,879
They'd sell it for just fifty million?

151
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,960
No. I'm talking about the ransom.

152
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,279
What do you mean?

153
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,120
Pay me fifty million, and I'll let you go.

154
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,960
What?

155
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:59,200
Will they still care about Miss Saikhim
now she costs so much more?

156
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,879
Will your dad pick you
or the money this time?

157
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,680
Who are you exactly?

158
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,200
What do you want?

159
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,240
-Mr. Sansern, please help!
-Miss Khim?

160
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,319
What's wrong?

161
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,799
I've abducted her!
Pay me fifty million and I'll let her go.

162
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,759
Where are you now?

163
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,880
On her way to hell!

164
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,839
-What the hell are you doing?
-Taking you home with me, darling!

165
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,599
Thank goodness.

166
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,680
Why doesn't he pick up?

167
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,119
Where did he go to find gas?

168
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,079
Your driver is at the beach.
Get in, I'll drive you there.

169
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,359
I… can drive myself.

170
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,359
Can you?

171
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,720
I can drive it.

172
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,400
Are you sure?

173
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,559
BOAT CAPTAIN

174
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:13,839
Help me!

175
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,680
Is anyone there? Help me!

176
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:22,960
TANTAI

177
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,720
I DON'T KNOW IF HEAVEN IS REAL,
BUT I WANTED TO WRITE TO SAY HELLO…

178
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,400
I don't know if heaven is real,

179
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:38,920
but I wanted to write to say hello.

180
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:43,400
I want you to know I still remember you.

181
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,599
Seven years is a long time,

182
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,599
but for you up there,

183
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,599
it's probably just the blink of an eye.

184
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,119
They say

185
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,519
some people stay in your heart
longer than they're with you.

186
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,400
I just understood that saying today.

187
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:03,559
Those four months

188
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,799
changed my life forever…

189
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:23,519
so I wanted to write to ask this.

190
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:26,519
If we could change one thing in this life,

191
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,400
would you make sure we never met?

192
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,119
I wish I could know
whether our answers were the same.

193
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:41,200
Hey, kid.

194
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,039
This is your dad.

195
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,559
I'm working in the forests.

196
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,839
It's pitch dark,
but the sky is full of stars.

197
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,319
Should we call our baby Temfah?
If it's a girl, we could call her Temfah.

198
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,960
But if it's a boy,

199
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,519
could we call him Nannam?

200
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,559
Have you guys met each other yet?

201
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,279
Wait for me, okay?

202
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,559
I'll follow you there.

203
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,240
Please help. She's hurt.

204
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,400
She can't take a helicopter now.

205
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,440
It's safer to leave tomorrow morning.

206
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:11,640
Please stay here, miss.
At least there's electricity here.

207
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,279
Thank you for helping me.

208
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:19,160
Maybe if you just rest,
you'll feel better tomorrow.

209
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,839
Please take care of her.
We'll come back tomorrow morning.

210
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,400
Whose house is this? Why are you here?

211
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,039
My phone battery died.
Can I use your phone to call my family?

212
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:13,240
There are no phones here.

213
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,880
Do you have a phone charger?

214
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
Take a pill and sleep.

215
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,000
I'll see you off tomorrow.

216
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,720
If you need anything,
I'm sleeping out there.

217
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,079
Sorry.

218
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,079
That number can't be reached right now.

219
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,759
Miss Khim hasn't called yet.
She must be on the island.

220
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,640
Why did you let her go alone?

221
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:40,640
This isn't the first time
Khim has disappeared.

222
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,440
Maybe she's just out there having fun.

223
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,759
But I think this time,
she won't be as unfortunate as last time.

224
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,519
Go to Phuket now.

225
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,920
I need to hear from Saikhim tonight.

226
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,559
Yes, sir.

227
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:07,960
You don't need to worry.
She's not a little kid anymore.

228
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:11,039
If this company had
trustworthy people sharing the workload,

229
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,599
Khim wouldn't have to work so hard alone.

230
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,880
She went looking for trouble.
How dare he blame me for this?

231
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:42,359
Excuse me.

232
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,319
Why do you look like someone I once knew?

233
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,000
The world isn't that small.

234
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,799
He's dead.

235
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,559
You do look like you've seen a ghost.

236
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,720
Gla, calm down.

237
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:59,480
Gla, listen to me! Gla, calm down!

238
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
Please calm down.

239
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,480
Gla.

240
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:09,599
Gla.

241
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,720
Gla, don't go yet.

242
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,759
Gla, don't run away again!

243
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:18,640
Gla, stay. Gla, don't run away again.

244
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,680
Gla, stay!

245
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:22,079
Please don't do this.

246
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,920
Do I seem that awful?

247
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,160
It hurts like I'm being stabbed

248
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,839
when you look at me like that.

249
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,640
Wanna know how much it hurts?

250
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:35,720
-Please let go.
-Khim.

251
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,079
Gla.

252
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,720
I'm sorry.

253
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,359
I didn't mean it.

254
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,160
Didn't mean it?

255
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:50,279
You don't know what I've been through.

256
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:54,119
Gla!

257
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,839
Gla.

258
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:04,920
Wake up, son.

259
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:09,160
Hold on a bit longer.

260
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,240
Be strong, son.

261
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,720
We've been through so much.

262
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,799
Don't give up yet.

263
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,599
My son is still in danger.

264
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,279
The new kidney has prolonged his life.

265
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,400
But we don't know when he'll wake up.

266
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:56,559
Take this.

267
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,839
It's the compensation
we agreed to in our contract.

268
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,319
PAY GAOGLA CHAYODOM FIVE MILLION BAHT

269
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,679
I can't take it.

270
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,199
I'm not selling my kids.

271
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,119
But your son wanted to leave you this.

272
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,039
It's not worth it.

273
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,480
No matter the amount.

274
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:25,719
In that case, let me repay you this way.

275
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:31,360
I'll make sure Gaogla receives
the lightest possible sentence,

276
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,159
or that he at least gets to recover
outside the prison

277
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,039
till he serves his full sentence.

278
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:39,119
No matter what happens next,

279
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,119
I promise to look after him

280
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,679
like he's one of my own heirs.

281
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,199
I will protect him

282
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,159
just like I protect my own son.

283
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,199
I promise.

284
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:59,320
Dad.

285
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,239
Gla.

286
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,440
Gla.

287
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,239
My son.

288
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:57,079
Bone marrow transplant is ready.

289
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,760
THE KIDAKARNS OF LUXE HOTELS

290
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:35,800
What doesn't kill us
makes us stronger, Saikhim.

291
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,639
The world isn't that small.

292
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,280
KHEM

293
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,719
About time you picked up.
What have you been doing? I'm here now.

294
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:32,400
Gla?

295
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:38,800
It really is him.

296
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,880
Who's that? Gla, can you hear me?

297
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,039
Gla?

298
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:53,480
Gla.

299
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,039
Gaogla!

300
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,639
Did you lie to me on purpose?

301
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:02,880
Did you?

302
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:04,559
Gaogla.

303
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:09,960
Gla!

304
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,199
Gaogla!

305
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,239
Gla!

306
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,920
Did you lie to me?

307
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,840
Gla!

308
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:45,440
Why didn't you say it's you?
You're still alive.

309
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,760
Why did you lie?

310
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,519
Why are you acting like a stranger?

311
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,000
What are you talking about?

312
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,480
Stop lying to me.

313
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:59,639
I know the whole truth. Why did you lie?

314
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:01,880
Since when were we close?

315
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,119
I don't remember us
truly knowing each other.

316
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,199
What do you mean?

317
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,719
We used to live together,

318
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,639
but that doesn't necessarily mean
we really knew each other.

319
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:13,960
Some people can't be trusted.

320
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,400
What did I ever do to you?

321
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,119
It was you

322
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:24,880
who made me believe you were dead.

323
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,199
Yeah!

324
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,400
The Gla you knew is dead.

325
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:32,440
I'm not that idiot anymore.

326
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:35,079
Well, who are you now?

327
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:36,320
And why are you here?

328
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,400
To kill you, maybe.

329
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,280
It's too bad you survived yesterday.

330
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,960
What did I ever do to you?

331
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:44,320
Didn't you tell me

332
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,079
that what doesn't kill us
will make us stronger?

333
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,480
-Let go.
-You should have made sure I died.

334
00:42:57,559 --> 00:42:59,280
Now I'm back to make you pay.

335
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,920
Let go!

336
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:24,360
Miss Khim? What's going on?

337
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,599
But that's…

338
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,440
Get me out of here.

339
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:33,159
Let's go!

340
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:06,719
What's going on?

341
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:11,599
Didn't Gla attempt suicide in jail?
Why is he still alive?

342
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:14,119
The medical documents said
he was brain-dead.

343
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:16,360
He can't possibly have survived.

344
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:18,760
I need to know what happened.

345
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,960
Mr. Sansern, please find out for me now.

346
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:25,559
I'll take care of it,
but you should get ready to travel now.

347
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,920
The Hong Kong event is tonight.

348
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,119
But I really must know what happened.

349
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:32,280
It's been seven years.

350
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,960
Where has he been?

351
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,159
Madame is waiting inside.

352
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:22,199
In there, sir.

353
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:31,519
It's me.

354
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,840
I'm back.

355
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:07,599
I've been waiting for updates.
How are things over there?

356
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:12,719
Paris wants us to pay
ten million euros in damages.

357
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,480
Very crafty.

358
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:17,800
The case is ongoing.

359
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,199
Our lawyers are buying us time.

360
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,920
I'm not giving up so easily.

361
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,480
These people want to use the law
to hamstring our business.

362
00:46:58,119 --> 00:46:59,440
We must be careful,

363
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:01,280
even when we're here.

364
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,079
I'm trying to find legal ways
for us to launch in the market here.

365
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,880
It won't be easy,

366
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,079
but if we sign an MOU with the government,

367
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:23,599
there should be no problems.

368
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:25,760
If we could enter the stock market,

369
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,559
things would get better.

370
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,000
I don't regret

371
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:37,679
letting you follow your dreams.

372
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:41,960
Your father must be very proud

373
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:43,920
that you took after him.

374
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,719
You were on a plane all night

375
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,480
and just landed.

376
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:55,480
Would you have time to hang out
with your brother for one night?

377
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:57,000
I can't stay the night.

378
00:47:57,079 --> 00:47:58,880
But I can have dinner here.

379
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,639
Let me go and say hi to him.

380
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,199
Do you think I don't know

381
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,320
where you've been hiding?

382
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,480
I brought you something.

383
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:51,880
I thought you'd be late.

384
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,360
Thanks for flying here
to take care of things for me.

385
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:01,119
Here. Wait.

386
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,480
I called this morning.

387
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:04,800
Who did you sleep with?

388
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,960
Aren't you sick of Thai women?

389
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,360
I didn't wanna come back
'cause you guys are all up in my business.

390
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:21,199
I figured you'd be tired of Western food,

391
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:24,079
so I had them prepare Thai food.

392
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:25,840
I got this for you.

393
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:39,360
You found time to think of me?

394
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:45,280
Next time, I'll fly you over
so we can pick something out together.

395
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:55,719
Hey.

396
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,800
A lady's perfume? Whose is it?

397
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,920
My sweet boy,
don't tell me you've been misbehaving.

398
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:04,519
I'd love to misbehave.

399
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,079
But I'm too loyal,

400
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,360
so I've got no time for anyone else.

401
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,079
No time or no attention?

402
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,119
You even forgot
to set your watch to local time here.

403
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,079
I did think
this breakfast looked over-the-top.

404
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,079
But it's actually our lunch.

405
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:44,119
No need to call.

406
00:50:44,199 --> 00:50:48,920
Mr. Sansern said Saikhim is on her way.
She must be on her flight right now.

407
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,119
Then that's okay.
I was scared she wouldn't make it tonight.

408
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:54,039
Tantai.

409
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:58,000
It's her own hotel's grand opening.
Why would she miss it?

410
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,159
Looking for a plus-one?

411
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,000
What do you think? Is he cute?

412
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,280
Men aren't props

413
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,400
that you can use to boost your image.

414
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:27,960
No one values that sort of thing.

415
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,920
And we're here for work, all right?

416
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:35,960
As if you have no ulterior motive.

417
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,400
What's up with you? Aren't you hungry?

418
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,960
I didn't know you were so romantic,

419
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:27,239
Tantai.

420
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,519
Go on, show me.
How will you propose to Saikhim?

421
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:44,920
Practice.

422
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,639
Try it first. Pretend I'm Saikhim.

423
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:51,880
Don't be shy. Come on.

424
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,920
Don't be ridiculous.

425
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:22,079
I'VE KNOWN YOU 20 YEARS
AND LOVED YOU THREE…

426
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,239
He wrote a script?

427
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,719
So corny.

428
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,199
Khim.

429
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,760
Tan.

430
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,119
Wait. What?

431
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:44,079
What happened?

432
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,639
I was a huge klutz
and hit my head on the plane window.

433
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,639
I was calling you all day yesterday,
but your phone was off.

434
00:53:53,719 --> 00:53:55,119
Were you busy?

435
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,639
I… lost my phone.

436
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:01,559
But I got a new one.

437
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,320
It's almost time.

438
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,760
I think you should get to your room.

439
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,960
-Sure.
-Let's go.

440
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:12,519
Khim?

441
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:24,199
In the end, that really was Gaogla.

442
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:26,800
And he seemed so angry.

443
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,639
Why would he be mad at you?

444
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,679
Because he didn't die?

445
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,480
You're the one who should be shocked.

446
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:33,440
Exactly.

447
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,280
He's been alive all this time.

448
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,159
Why have I heard
nothing from him for seven years?

449
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,840
So what was he like?
Does he still look kind of rough?

450
00:54:57,559 --> 00:55:00,400
He seemed… kind of different.

451
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,079
Both his character and the way he spoke.

452
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,360
He was in prison for ages.

453
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,639
Maybe he was hiding

454
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:11,400
because he couldn't face you.

455
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,840
He's in the past now.

456
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,199
Even if he had lived,

457
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,800
you're way out of his league.

458
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:45,559
He should know very well by now

459
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,320
that he's not worthy of you, Saikhim.

460
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,480
Anyway, now,

461
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,360
you're in a serious relationship.

462
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,559
Ta-da!

463
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:20,199
Are you ready?

464
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:23,679
I'm ready.

465
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,480
You're getting a surprise tonight.

466
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:31,519
We're ready. We're so ready.

467
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:35,239
There.

468
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,480
I don't think the business reporters care
who designed this place.

469
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,199
Since this is a work event,

470
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:13,840
you shouldn't steal the spotlight
from Khim tonight, you know?

471
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,400
Khim doesn't like to mix
work with her personal life, okay?

472
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
If you get down on one knee
and propose to her here…

473
00:58:23,719 --> 00:58:25,239
it's not a good look for CEOs.

474
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:28,719
Then you should shut up about it.

475
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:32,039
Hey.

476
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,880
I warned you because I mean well.
You should be grateful.

477
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,079
I'd rather you stopped interfering.

478
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:42,679
By the way, there's one more thing, Tan.

479
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:46,559
You should say this.

480
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:47,719
Don't use your script.

481
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:54,599
YOU: TEN YEARS FROM NOW,
IF YOU THINK OF ME…

482
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,400
Khim!

483
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:41,440
Khim?

484
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,079
Do you have more info on Gaogla yet?

485
01:00:45,159 --> 01:00:48,800
The latest info I have is
what I've already told you, Miss Khim.

486
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:52,159
He was severely ill with brain death
while serving time.

487
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:54,760
There's no info on him after that point.

488
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:00,199
So does that mean
that his death was never reported?

489
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:04,960
I think he must have expunged
his own records somewhat

490
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:09,039
because for the past two or three years,
we've no idea where he's been.

491
01:01:09,639 --> 01:01:14,119
As for his family, we can't even find
any info on them either.

492
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,039
-But that's…
-What's wrong, miss?

493
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,159
He's here.

494
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:05,159
Who is, miss?

495
01:02:05,719 --> 01:02:06,840
Gaogla.

496
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:10,119
He's at tonight's event.

497
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:11,519
Are you sure it's him?

498
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:14,280
I think something weird is going on.

499
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:54,000
This will be huge news tomorrow.

500
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:59,280
The media around the world will talk
about Claire debuting her partner tonight.

501
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,880
Tan, do you know them from somewhere?

502
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,119
Not at all.

503
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,920
I don't really follow
celebrity news anyway.

504
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:22,480
But I think maybe that man might be
some sort of famous actor or athlete.

505
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:36,840
Khim, you don't mind them
stealing your spotlight, do you?

506
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:38,400
Well…

507
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,039
Khim?

508
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:50,800
Yeah?

509
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,239
This is great. We can celebrate alone.

510
01:03:59,239 --> 01:04:01,159
You never told me you'd be here too.

511
01:04:01,239 --> 01:04:02,280
It's a surprise.

512
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,599
You're the cutest.

513
01:04:03,679 --> 01:04:04,679
You like the flowers?

514
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:07,000
I love them.

515
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:17,519
Khim?

516
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:19,079
Are you tired?

517
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:24,440
I've… noticed that you've worked so hard
on this hotel, you know?

518
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,079
Are you happy with it?

519
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,119
I'd love to know

520
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,679
what could make your life
even more complete.

521
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,880
I don't know.

522
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:48,400
This world is always
full of problems to solve.

523
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,159
I want to be a part of your successes.

524
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:59,280
I'd like to ask you to invest
as my joint venture partner for life.

525
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,000
Khim… I'm sorry.

526
01:05:07,639 --> 01:05:09,159
It's all right, Tan.

527
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:10,079
I'll clean it up.

528
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,159
Wait, Tan.

529
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:13,559
-Yes?
-What a mess.

530
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:15,760
What's this?

531
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,519
It's nothing.

532
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:34,800
What's that?

533
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:45,880
I meant to be discreet.

534
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:52,400
I want to be there
for all your successes just like tonight,

535
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,519
to play a small part

536
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:56,320
in a dark corner like this.

537
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,239
Marry me.

538
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,320
Khim.

539
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:32,159
Let's go and watch.

540
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,679
Think of this as our celebration.

541
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:28,159
I almost forgot
there's someone I want you to meet.

542
01:07:39,239 --> 01:07:40,480
Miss Khim?

543
01:07:45,239 --> 01:07:46,239
This is Carl.

544
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:51,199
Carl?

545
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,159
Carl Raman. He's half Thai, half Kazakh.

546
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:59,159
His name comes from his Thai name, Gaogla.

547
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,840
It's nice to meet you… Carl.

548
01:08:08,719 --> 01:08:10,719
Miss Saikhim runs this project.

549
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:14,360
It's all thanks to her that this hotel
turned out so pretty.

550
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,199
It's nice to meet you.

551
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,880
Let me congratulate the bride-to-be.

552
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:36,399
Excuse me?

553
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,520
You're a very lucky man.

554
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:42,840
Very lucky indeed.

555
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,960
I had no idea.

556
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:50,520
Congratulations, Miss Khim.

557
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,680
This makes me so jealous.

558
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:01,279
Who knows when I'll be so lucky?

559
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,279
Why should you be jealous?

560
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:08,439
Someone once told me that good men
are harder to find than rings.

561
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,800
Good men…

562
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,399
are harder to find than rings.

563
01:09:13,479 --> 01:09:15,159
If I can have a good husband…

564
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,319
I don't want a ring.

565
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,319
People who say that stuff must be

566
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:24,960
so naive.

567
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:29,439
They're either optimistic
or just trying to look good.

568
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:30,880
All talk, no action.

569
01:09:31,479 --> 01:09:33,239
-Don't you think?
-What do you mean?

570
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:42,039
How is it possible?
How did things reach this point?

571
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,880
He changed his whole name.
That's why we couldn't find him.

572
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:49,560
How did he up his game
enough to date Claire?

573
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:51,720
I don't know.

574
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,119
He wants to blackmail me.

575
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:19,479
Khim.

576
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:21,079
Are you okay, Khim?

577
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,000
You're all red. Did you drink a lot?

578
01:10:25,079 --> 01:10:25,960
I'm okay.

579
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,319
I'll talk to him properly.

580
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,359
Wait, Khim!

581
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,720
Why did you send that?

582
01:10:54,439 --> 01:10:57,920
You can change your phone,
but you can't hide from the past.

583
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,279
Deleted files can be restored.

584
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:03,359
I can't believe
I remembered your passcode.

585
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:06,039
If you don't want anyone to snoop,

586
01:11:06,119 --> 01:11:07,199
be more careful.

587
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:13,600
Are you anxious?

588
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,640
Are you scared people will hear our story?

589
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:19,800
We don't have a story.

590
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:23,119
We just did something dumb
when we were younger.

591
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,479
Don't let go. Hey!

592
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:42,359
Pull me up!

593
01:11:42,439 --> 01:11:43,880
Now you beg for your life?

594
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:46,039
Don't you remember

595
01:11:46,119 --> 01:11:47,479
what you did to me then?

596
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:49,479
-I won't jump.
-Too bad.

597
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:51,199
Hey!

598
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,920
So you're making me pay?

599
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,920
You nearly got me killed.

600
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,960
I helped you!

601
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:02,359
So I'll repay you now.

602
01:12:22,119 --> 01:12:23,079
Don't let me go.

603
01:12:34,039 --> 01:12:35,039
Khim!

604
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:38,720
It'd be a shame
if your expensive purse got wet.

605
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:40,680
It may be worth more than you.

606
01:12:42,039 --> 01:12:43,279
Gla!

607
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:45,600
Khim!

608
01:12:48,439 --> 01:12:49,680
Tan!

609
01:12:53,239 --> 01:12:54,640
-Tan.
-Khim.

610
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,840
Khim!

611
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:04,840
There.

612
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:06,880
Your phone's down there.

613
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:14,520
Khim!

614
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,079
Just forget it, Tan.

615
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,840
-Is this a pool party now?
-You…

616
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:38,359
Let's just go.

617
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:44,760
Sorry. Excuse us.

618
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,720
Wait, sir. Your partner left this.

619
01:13:59,159 --> 01:14:00,199
Thank you.

620
01:14:06,199 --> 01:14:07,439
Hey. What happened?

621
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:09,880
Is she drunk?

622
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:10,800
I don't know.

623
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:13,399
Maybe she's drunk on love.

624
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:21,319
He made you fall in. What a jerk.

625
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:25,079
-He came back to make me pay.
-Who does he think he is?

626
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,159
That's Claire's room.

627
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,399
Let's look for clues
and find out who this Carl really is.

628
01:14:36,479 --> 01:14:37,720
Let's go.

629
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:42,640
Hurry, Fern.

630
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:04,000
Go ahead. I'll keep watch.

631
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:04,920
Okay.

632
01:16:24,119 --> 01:16:25,239
Khim?

633
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:27,800
Hi, Tan. Are you finished with the press?

634
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,680
-Where's Khim?
-Khim?

635
01:16:31,279 --> 01:16:32,359
She's in her room.

636
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,479
I tried the doorbell,
but I guess she didn't hear it.

637
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,920
I thought she couldn't get in
without her key card.

638
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,680
Khim!

639
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:50,800
What's wrong?

640
01:16:53,239 --> 01:16:54,079
Go inside.

641
01:16:56,119 --> 01:16:58,399
Khim!

642
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,359
I dealt with the press for you.

643
01:17:00,439 --> 01:17:02,399
The reporters have all left.

644
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:09,079
She's still taking a shower.
Why don't you go get changed first?

645
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:12,479
She said she lost her old phone.

646
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,279
So why was it in the pool?

647
01:17:17,079 --> 01:17:18,880
He came back to make me pay.

648
01:18:12,439 --> 01:18:13,319
Hey, Tan.

649
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:16,720
Dry your hair first, oppa,
then dry yourself all over.

650
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,359
What are you up to?

651
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:31,840
Well…

652
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:35,680
I'm going to return Khim's phone.

653
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,960
Khim said she lost her old phone,
so how do you explain this?

654
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:48,720
Well…

655
01:18:50,119 --> 01:18:51,800
I guess she's exhausted.

656
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:53,800
She's been working so hard lately.

657
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:56,359
That's why she's being weird.
Don't worry about that.

658
01:18:58,039 --> 01:19:01,279
Wait. Tantai, maybe you're jealous.

659
01:19:03,319 --> 01:19:05,720
Do you think Khim keeps a second phone

660
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,079
to chat with someone else?

661
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,800
That's nonsense. She wouldn't do that.

662
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:26,960
Go on.

663
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:55,960
Looking for something?

664
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,520
Satisfy your curiosity.

665
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,760
You rich people are nosy, aren't you?

666
01:20:16,279 --> 01:20:17,880
You don't even apologize.

667
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:20,079
I guess your family doesn't value manners.

668
01:20:24,279 --> 01:20:28,000
Actually, I think you're the one
who should be apologizing.

669
01:20:28,079 --> 01:20:30,239
You humiliated me on purpose.

670
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:35,920
What? I thought you wanted to reminisce.
Isn't that why you've been bothering me?

671
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:37,479
Who did that?

672
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,439
Who bothered whom?

673
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,640
You did it last night.

674
01:20:45,159 --> 01:20:46,680
Tonight, you invaded my room.

675
01:20:52,079 --> 01:20:53,760
You know when we last drank together?

676
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,920
I still remember what it was like.

677
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,760
I don't know what you've been through.

678
01:21:04,439 --> 01:21:08,079
You got richer, but that doesn't mean
you became a better person.

679
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,039
Maybe instead,

680
01:21:10,119 --> 01:21:11,760
you became a worse one.

681
01:21:13,479 --> 01:21:15,119
I don't know why you're so hateful,

682
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:16,640
but don't take it out on me.

683
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:29,960
I didn't do anything.

684
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,520
You're experiencing

685
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,560
what's called karma.

686
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:44,960
Khim? Do you want some hot food?
I could get you room service.

687
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:47,680
Can you hear me?

688
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:50,520
Why is she so quiet?

689
01:21:52,119 --> 01:21:53,479
Maybe she's…

690
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:55,479
Khim?

691
01:21:57,239 --> 01:21:58,399
Khim?

692
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,560
Khim, can you hear me?
Tan's here. Get out of there.

693
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:20,920
Why are you blushing?

694
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,319
Khim!

695
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:26,039
What are you doing? Get out!

696
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,039
Back off.

697
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,119
What's wrong?

698
01:22:38,199 --> 01:22:39,800
Do you think I'll hurt you?

699
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,640
I know… that you came back to make me pay.

700
01:22:47,239 --> 01:22:48,319
Khim's not in here.

701
01:22:54,119 --> 01:22:57,560
If you're so paranoid,
you must have a guilty conscience.

702
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,680
You must know
what you did to me was wrong.

703
01:23:00,399 --> 01:23:03,479
Well, you're a nutcase!
Of course I'm afraid of you!

704
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:06,840
Be afraid of your own heart.
I think women like you are more dangerous.

705
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:09,760
Khim! Tan is here.

706
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:10,720
Come out now!

707
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:16,359
-What are you doing?
-I told you.

708
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:18,840
You should have killed me.

709
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:20,119
This time,

710
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:21,920
it's my turn.

711
01:23:23,079 --> 01:23:24,439
You do have bad intentions.

712
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:28,560
I can't breathe!

713
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:34,199
Do you really want to kill me?

714
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:41,199
Hey. Wait!

715
01:23:51,279 --> 01:23:52,119
Khim!

716
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:56,079
Khim! What's wrong?

717
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:58,760
Khim, what's wrong?

718
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:02,760
Khim!

719
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,439
Khim? What's going on?

720
01:24:07,159 --> 01:24:10,920
Tan, help me. I can't breathe.

721
01:24:13,159 --> 01:24:14,359
What happened to you?

722
01:24:14,439 --> 01:24:15,760
Why is she so red?

723
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,359
She needs a doctor!

724
01:24:18,399 --> 01:24:20,640
-Khim?
-Let's take her to the hospital!

725
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:44,319
Khim has a severe pollen allergy
and has to stay overnight.

726
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:49,359
Pollen? But… where did it come from?

727
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:52,880
They said she's allergic to some flowers,
but we don't know which ones.

728
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,079
So… is she awake yet?

729
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:00,640
She's feeling better.

730
01:25:01,239 --> 01:25:02,560
She's moving to her own room.

731
01:25:10,279 --> 01:25:13,920
If you have a date, you can go.
We can manage on our own here.

732
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,039
Didn't you tell me

733
01:25:28,119 --> 01:25:30,760
that what doesn't kill us
will make us stronger?

734
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:41,079
-Let go.
-You should have made sure I died.

735
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,479
Now I'm back to make you pay.

736
01:25:45,279 --> 01:25:46,279
Those bees…

737
01:25:48,319 --> 01:25:49,359
Those flowers…

738
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:54,319
What are you doing?

739
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:01,239
It can't be a coincidence.

740
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,720
TWO YEARS AGO

741
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:37,399
It really was him.

742
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:43,119
You're still wandering around in my life.

743
01:27:53,479 --> 01:27:55,079
Did you come back to kill me?

744
01:28:02,079 --> 01:28:05,920
I wonder if Romeo and Juliet's love
was so heartbreaking

745
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,159
because it ended when they both died.

746
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:11,239
If misunderstandings didn't lead them
to kill themselves,

747
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,439
their love

748
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,319
may not have lasted very long.

749
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:21,159
They said you were dead.

750
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:23,199
I'm too stubborn to die.

751
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,119
So why are you here?

752
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:26,600
To watch my enemy die.

753
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:32,000
I've never wanted to hurt anyone!
But today, I wish you would die!

754
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:33,800
-Hey!
-Then we'd never meet again!

755
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:35,079
Who was that woman?

756
01:28:35,159 --> 01:28:36,520
You nag more than Khim does.

757
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:39,159
Well, she doesn't know
that you're cheating on her.

758
01:28:39,239 --> 01:28:41,159
If you get lonely or bored,

759
01:28:41,239 --> 01:28:42,199
call me.

760
01:28:42,279 --> 01:28:43,840
What's Prom doing?

761
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,760
Getting someone to investigate Gaogla.

762
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,319
Don't get involved. It could be a trap.

763
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:50,560
He wants us to get suspicious

764
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:52,800
so he can entrap us for snooping.

765
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,640
I won't get caught like you, dummy.

766
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:57,159
-Gloy.
-Don't worry.

767
01:28:57,239 --> 01:28:59,880
I'm still around.
I'm destined to live a long life.

768
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:35,880
