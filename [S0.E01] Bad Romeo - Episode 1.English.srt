THIS FICTIONAL SERIES IS INTENDED
FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY

2
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,000
If we could turn back time
and make one thing right between us,

3
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,719
what would you change?

4
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,480
Don't!

5
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,480
Hey!

6
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,000
THE BEGINNING… LOVE

7
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,319
Someone once said

8
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,319
that I'd find the right person
at the right time one day.

9
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,079
But you never know when that day is.

10
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,000
Most importantly, there's no way to know

11
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,840
that this person will always be the one.

12
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,040
THIS PERSON WILL ALWAYS BE THE ONE

13
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,079
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

14
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,439
2015

15
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:00,439
-Khim.
-Hey. Lita.

16
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,439
Khim, let's meet upstairs.
I'll run up there.

17
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,360
I'm sorry.

18
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,439
Sorry.

19
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,039
So sorry.

20
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,280
Khim.

21
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,360
I've missed you.

22
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,879
So how are you?

23
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,439
Sorry, I didn't think
the flight would be so delayed.

24
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,919
It's okay. Look at me.

25
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,639
Do I look like a Londoner yet? Do I?

26
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,960
Yeah.

27
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,159
Have fun in your new life.

28
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,280
Here's a map and the keys. There.

29
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,360
Soon you'll see
how boring it is to be Lita.

30
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,080
Lita.

31
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,360
Don't let anyone suspect us.

32
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,280
All right. I promise.

33
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,960
I won't let anyone wonder
where Miss Saikhim has disappeared to.

34
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,959
Wait.

35
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:22,720
Smile.

36
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,199
One. Two. Three.

37
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,879
Enjoy your new life.

38
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,720
You too, Lita.

39
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,040
This life swap

40
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,199
could improve both our lives, you know.

41
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,639
Absolutely, because I

42
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,160
will live these ten days

43
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,120
to the fullest as if I were a new person.

44
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,959
Gla.

45
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,759
What shall we eat?

46
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,600
I don't know. Let's see what's there.

47
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,839
Why are you going for so long this time?

48
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,800
I just have so many flights to do.

49
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,240
You'd better be good.

50
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,720
Take good care of the baby.

51
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,279
You only care about the baby.
Aren't you worried I'll cheat?

52
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,040
You're welcome to try.

53
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,399
You'll be gone so long.
Who will I hold at night?

54
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,560
You don't get left behind.
You wouldn't understand.

55
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,600
Fine.

56
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,560
I promise I'll be good.

57
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,800
When you get back,
I'll pay you back for this.

58
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,279
Of course you will.

59
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,079
Hello. Welcome home, sweetie.

60
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,000
How are you?

61
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,959
-Good to see you.
-Are you tired? Let's go.

62
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,879
I'm so tired.

63
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,839
Hey, could this
possibly make you feel better, Noey?

64
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,959
This is mine?

65
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,879
I'll customize it even more first,

66
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,759
then this car will be all yours, Noey.

67
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,519
Wow. Thank you so much.

68
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,199
-Come on. Let's get in.
-Okay.

69
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,160
In these ten days,

70
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,920
you'll live life to the fullest.

71
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,959
Step one is losing your rich girl image.

72
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:12,720
What? Does Lita have a cat?

73
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,800
Bombay, Daddy's home.

74
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:16,920
Bombay, baby?

75
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,040
Bombay?

76
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,319
Meow?

77
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,040
Bombay, come to Daddy.

78
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,960
I got this phone for you
as a surprise present.

79
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,600
Hey, I signed you up to a dating service
and picked five local guys for you.

80
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,240
Ew.

81
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,559
Don't say, "Ew."

82
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:54,360
I only picked guys
who aren't sleazy or creepy.

83
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,879
Stop acting so innocent.
Just try meeting the guys I picked.

84
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,679
If you want to live a full life,
you need to have a lover.

85
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,440
I hit on them for you.

86
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,120
You can do the rest.

87
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,080
We women never truly live
if we're too modest.

88
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,120
Get yourself a lover
to spice your life up a bit, okay?

89
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,399
GAOGLA

90
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,000
GAOGLA LIKES THE SIMPLE LIFESTYLE

91
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,080
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I miss you all the time.

92
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,639
I'm near you, but my heart is even closer.

93
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,759
If you're lonely, talk to me.

94
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:44,639
Ew.

95
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,440
What did you do, Lita?

96
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,799
My sweet Khim.

97
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,960
Don't look at me like that.
You're making me blush.

98
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,960
Having fun? You lost my baby.

99
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,639
Stop flirting.

100
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,200
-Find my cat first.
-Hey! Bro!

101
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,799
Hey.

102
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,879
Are you hurt, Khim?

103
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,799
Hey.

104
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,480
You catfished women with my photo again?

105
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,559
Well, you have a welcoming face.

106
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,919
It gets lots of views.

107
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,799
Look at all the messages I got.

108
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,679
You shamelessly used me
to get women into bed?

109
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,600
If you abduct a minor,
will I go to jail for you?

110
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,879
Come on, bro. It's just harmless flirting.
There's no sex. Don't defame Khim.

111
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,799
Whatever.

112
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,000
Isn't this app for hookups?

113
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,279
There they are. Look at them all.

114
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,360
Khim isn't that kind of person.

115
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,039
Come on, bro. Give me my phone back.

116
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,480
-I'm talking to her.
-You seek true love from strangers.

117
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,000
How can you find the real deal?

118
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,440
You can't expect people who want hookups
to be sincere with you.

119
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,639
They just want notches on their bedposts.
Stop daydreaming, Khem.

120
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,000
If you still can't tell sex from love,

121
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,159
you won't find true love in this life.

122
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,960
Is it that bad, bro?

123
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,120
Of course.

124
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,399
Hey. Meow. Come over here, Bombay.

125
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,399
Come on, bro.

126
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:11,440
In real life,
everyone sees my face and runs away.

127
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,879
My face isn't as nice as yours.

128
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,440
So find someone
who loves you for who you are.

129
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,000
If you want to meet the real deal,

130
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,919
stop using these phony apps.

131
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,399
Find a good woman with a job like I did.

132
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,159
Here you go again.

133
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,759
You're always talking her up.

134
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,720
My phone… You're always dodging me.

135
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,960
Stop it, Khem.

136
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,360
If you look hard enough,

137
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,840
one day, you'll find
an honest woman like Yamsom.

138
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,000
Hey, bro.

139
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,960
What? Hey.

140
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:45,320
Hey, bro. But how will I talk to her?

141
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,840
Noodles with dumplings.

142
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,120
It's the noodle vendor.

143
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,399
-Let's go.
-Let's go, everyone.

144
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,240
Noodles with dumplings.

145
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,639
-You all want veggies?
-Yes, please.

146
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
-No.
-All right.

147
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:34,720
-Like always.
-Hello.

148
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,440
-Sure.
-What are you having?

149
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:37,639
Noodles with dumplings.

150
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,399
-I'd like a bowl too, please.
-Sure.

151
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,639
Want more noodles with dumplings?

152
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,320
-I want some.
-Me too.

153
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,720
That's everyone.

154
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,240
Sir, five more bowls, please.

155
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,000
-Sure. One moment.
-Okay.

156
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:01,559
All right, who just said
that they wanted to show me something?

157
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,240
-We did.
-We did.

158
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:04,639
Yeah? Show me.

159
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,480
One. Two. Three.

160
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,080
Oppa Gangnam Style

161
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,639
Sexy lady

162
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,039
Oppa Gangnam Style

163
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,679
Sexy lady

164
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,480
Hey, the train's here. We should go.

165
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,960
What? Where are you going?

166
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:37,000
-We're going home.
-We're going home.

167
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,320
What? You didn't finish your food.

168
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,799
Come back.

169
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:43,960
These kids got here on the free train.

170
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:46,759
When another free train comes,
they run to get on it.

171
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,120
Really?

172
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,840
-Then I'll pay for all that.
-Sure.

173
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,759
Are they ready?

174
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,000
Wait.

175
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,720
-What?
-Take these.

176
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,720
Thank you.

177
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,799
-Get on.
-Thank you.

178
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,000
-All right.
-Get on.

179
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,000
-Bye.
-Bye.

180
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,080
A biker's chick.

181
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:24,720
Sixteen baht.

182
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,960
I'm sorry.

183
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,240
-I… I changed my mind.
-It's okay.

184
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,440
She doesn't even have 16 baht?
Is she trying to fleece Khem?

185
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,279
Hey, watch out!

186
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,279
You should be careful.
The bikers here ride on the sidewalks.

187
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,039
Thank you.

188
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,559
-Miss, I'd like a sweet roti, please.
-Sure. Here you go.

189
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,480
Thank you.

190
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,559
-Hey, May.
-Yeah?

191
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,519
-The usual, please.
-Sure.

192
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:42,400
You're so generous.

193
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,680
May I have one?

194
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:48,440
-Sure. Here you go.
-Thank you.

195
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,799
Get your sweet roti here.

196
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,680
Would you like a sweet roti?

197
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:07,160
Sharing Is Caring Roti.

198
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
They're free.

199
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:14,960
Pardon?

200
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:17,319
Take them.

201
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,559
Take two. They'll fill you up.

202
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:23,400
Someone paid for them
so that anyone can take them for free.

203
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,759
It was him.

204
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,880
He used to live hand to mouth.

205
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,680
He knows what it's like to have no food.

206
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,640
When we have enough,
we should think of other people.

207
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,960
This one just came in.
The client wants to customize everything.

208
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,640
He said he'd give it to his girl
as a wedding present.

209
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,200
-It's nice to be rich.
-Hey, Khem.

210
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:11,119
-What?
-Did he forget something?

211
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,079
It's his girl's luggage.

212
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,160
I'll call him.

213
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,079
Wait.

214
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,319
It's just like Yamsom's.

215
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,240
What?

216
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,279
I saw it this morning.

217
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:26,720
Hey, it is hers.

218
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,119
That's crazy.

219
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,880
How can it be your girlfriend's?

220
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,880
You said she just got on a flight.

221
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,640
Well, yeah. Shouldn't it be on the plane?

222
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,400
Let's wait for it to land,

223
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,680
then call her
and ask if there was a mix-up.

224
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,319
As a successful businessperson,

225
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,519
Mr. Songseen, do you have a message
for young people?

226
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:14,279
In my opinion,
there's no shortcut to success.

227
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,440
If you want something,
you have to work hard for it.

228
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,799
Mr. Songseen, you work so hard.
How do you make time for your family?

229
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,359
My daughter is an only child.

230
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,359
I give her my all.

231
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,440
I've heard that Saikhim is a good girl.

232
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,759
And she's good at everything too, right?

233
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,200
That's right.

234
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,680
No matter what I ask her to do,

235
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:38,079
she never ever lets me down.

236
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:56,960
Dad.

237
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,799
Hi, Dad.

238
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,720
-What are you up to?
-Well…

239
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,119
I just got home.

240
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,359
Are you sure you're okay on your own?

241
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,640
Of course I'm okay alone.

242
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,359
Don't worry about me, Dad.

243
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,720
I can handle it.

244
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,880
If you get scared, tell me.
I'll find someone to keep you company.

245
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:47,559
I'm a big girl now, Dad.

246
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,440
Of course I can look after myself.

247
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:52,160
Don't make Auntie Oon feel bad
for going home without me.

248
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,200
She doesn't ask for leave that often.

249
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:00,079
You're thinking of other people.
You really are a big girl now.

250
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:02,839
What?

251
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:04,400
What did you say?

252
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,039
You paid me a huge compliment.
I'm blushing, of course.

253
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,799
See you at home in ten days.

254
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,880
Gla, have you seen this, bro?

255
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,440
She landed already?

256
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:22,839
She didn't answer.
She must be driving to her hotel.

257
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,279
What? No. Look closely, bro.

258
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,599
Look at what?

259
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,599
Come on, bro.

260
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,200
Your girlfriend didn't travel alone. Look.

261
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:32,240
See who she's with? Look at her glasses.

262
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,680
-Who's that?
-Come on, bro.

263
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,759
He's the rich guy who owns this Mini.

264
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,200
I bet you
that your girlfriend didn't fly anywhere.

265
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,720
That's why her luggage is here.

266
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:46,359
She only ran off with another guy.

267
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,799
She's cheating on you.

268
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,400
Don't you believe me?
We could go to her place.

269
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,559
They might be there now.

270
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,440
Thirty baht.

271
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,839
Will I survive these ten days?

272
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,559
Hey.

273
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:22,559
Why are you here?

274
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:25,319
This is my girlfriend's place.
And who are you?

275
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,640
Girlfriend?

276
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,319
You… you're my friend's boyfriend?

277
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,240
Friend?

278
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,279
So you know Yamsom?

279
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,319
I don't know Yamsom.

280
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,880
But I know my friend.

281
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,000
Lita.

282
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,559
-Who's she?
-She owns this place.

283
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,119
Why are her photos here?

284
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,920
Well, because she owns this place.

285
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,480
Yam?

286
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,119
-Yam, are you here?
-Sir…

287
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,440
Yam?

288
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:12,519
How did you get here?

289
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,359
Did you stalk me via that app?

290
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,559
I should ask you
what you're doing with my girlfriend.

291
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,359
Are you stalking me

292
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,279
by befriending my girlfriend, psycho?

293
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:24,359
No, I'm not.

294
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,599
I don't even know
how you and Lita know each other.

295
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:30,680
Whose is this?

296
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,400
-Hey.
-It's mine.

297
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,599
Leave me alone.

298
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,039
You're a trespasser,
and now you assault me too?

299
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:38,519
I'm not trespassing.

300
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,160
This is my friend's place.

301
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:44,359
A biker's chick is my girlfriend's friend?

302
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,079
A biker's what?

303
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,400
-Hey, mister.
-Hey!

304
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,720
-What are you doing?
-What?

305
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,119
Look at this.

306
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,519
Why is Yamsom's stuff here?

307
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,000
If it's not my house,
why are there photos of my girl?

308
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:04,880
Why are my photos here?

309
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:10,799
I paid for this house.

310
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,920
But I don't know
the woman in these photos.

311
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:21,000
It's not Lita's place?

312
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:23,119
I don't know. I don't know anything.

313
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,720
I just want to see my girlfriend.

314
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:26,799
Did she trick me?

315
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,119
I don't care.

316
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,759
Please leave my bride-to-be's home now.

317
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:34,079
I think you must have followed me
with bad intentions.

318
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,720
Get out.

319
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:40,480
Take all your stuff.

320
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,279
Leave the keys. Don't you dare come back.

321
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,240
Go home to your mom and dad.

322
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:00,680
Sorry.

323
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,799
That number can't be reached right now.

324
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,799
DAD

325
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,160
MOBILE

326
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:31,039
It's only been one day.

327
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,599
Why am I so weak?

328
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,200
I must survive.

329
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,039
Here we are, miss.

330
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:50,279
Thank you.

331
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,319
PAWN SHOP

332
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,480
She must need money.

333
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,920
She's still trying to swindle men.

334
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,559
Sorry.

335
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,519
That number can't be reached right now.

336
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,680
She's still not picking up?

337
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,519
Oh my word.

338
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,200
Sorry.

339
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,440
That number can't be reached right now.

340
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:33,200
London!

341
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,240
What room is this?

342
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,160
A personal sauna?

343
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,359
Sorry.

344
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,519
That number can't be reached right now.

345
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,279
I can't believe this.

346
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,839
Only ten days. It's so freaking worth it.

347
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,200
Who the hell is that?

348
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,039
Hello.

349
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,839
Is that you, Khim? It's me, Tan.

350
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,799
Who's Tan?

351
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,480
Khim has never mentioned him.

352
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,480
SAIKHIM

353
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,759
Hello, Saikhim.

354
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:57,359
You called at the right time.
I've no idea who just rang your doorbell.

355
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,519
Lita, explain yourself right now.

356
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,559
Whose house did you put me in?

357
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,759
Well, Khim?

358
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:05,000
Can you hear me, Khim?

359
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:08,039
Some guy just showed up
and said it was his house.

360
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:10,720
Lita, I've been kicked out, you know that?

361
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,680
Tell me the whole truth right now.

362
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,480
Well…

363
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,279
I rented that house for you.

364
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,200
What?

365
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,519
Oh no, Lita.
Didn't we say we'd swap houses?

366
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,119
Khim?

367
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,480
Can I please come in?

368
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,440
Hello?

369
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,640
Khim?

370
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:35,240
-Lita?
-Damn.

371
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,400
I meant well, Saikhim.

372
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,480
A rich girl like you can't live
in my tiny place.

373
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,200
I already rented that guy's place,
so you should stay there.

374
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,480
Khim?

375
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,160
Are you alone?

376
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,160
Hey.

377
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,440
Whose voice is that?

378
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,279
Well, I was going to ask you that.
Who is Tantai or whatever his name is?

379
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,400
Who is he? He came to see you.

380
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:58,960
Lita.

381
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,880
Don't go out there.

382
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,640
Don't let him know you're there.

383
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:06,839
Okay. I'll make him leave.

384
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,079
Miss Saikhim isn't here, sir.
She's not back from school yet.

385
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:19,279
And whom am I speaking to?

386
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,359
What now, dude?

387
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,119
Lita, don't say anything. Just be quiet.

388
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,319
Why am I in such deep trouble?

389
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,240
What? I think I'm in deeper trouble, Lita.

390
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:32,759
I'm the one who's been tricked.

391
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,920
Look, Tan is calling me now. I have to go.

392
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:47,680
Hello, Tan.

393
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:50,640
Khim, I came to see you at your place.

394
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,839
Aren't you at home?

395
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:54,319
Right. Well… you see…

396
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,640
I'm in the library at my university, Tan.

397
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,559
What's the matter?

398
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:04,119
Your dad said that you were alone,
and he asked me to check on you.

399
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,640
Shall we go for a drive?

400
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:09,680
And he also said
you don't have to go back to Thailand.

401
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:11,119
Right.

402
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,519
Maybe… next time, Tan?

403
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:19,000
You see, I want to go back to Thailand
to do a bit of research.

404
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:22,400
So shall we fly there together?

405
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,640
I… I still don't know

406
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,079
when I'd be able to go.

407
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:32,000
Tan, you don't have to wait for me, okay?

408
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,440
Well, all right.

409
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,480
If there's something urgent,
call me right away

410
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:38,640
for your dad's sake.

411
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,119
I will.

412
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,079
Thank you, Tan.

413
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:50,640
What if… he's Saikhim's secret boyfriend?

414
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,279
Why is he so handsome?

415
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,319
SAIKHIM

416
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,279
I'm sorry, Khim.

417
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,039
I need to think.

418
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:29,799
Sorry.

419
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,079
That number can't be reached right now.

420
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,559
She messed things up,
and now she's ditching me?

421
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,279
At 4:00 p.m. today, you have an interview
about the joint venture in Shanghai.

422
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,319
And dinner with the governor tonight, sir.

423
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:00,240
Wait, sir.

424
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,920
The bank says Miss Khim's credit cards
have been used in Thailand.

425
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,839
What?

426
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:09,400
Does Khim know this?
Maybe she's still asleep.

427
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,799
I've canceled the cards.

428
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:14,359
She was probably hacked
by online fraudsters.

429
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,440
Have them issue her new cards.
I want Khim to stay in England this term.

430
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,759
Yes, sir.

431
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:28,640
It's a pity
that Khim couldn't make it here in time.

432
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,119
Uncle, I've heard that you let Tantai

433
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,920
take Khim on holiday in Scotland.

434
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,240
What about it?

435
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,480
I'm just curious about Auntie Oon
asking for leave to go home.

436
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,000
Is it a coincidence?
Or is she making way for someone?

437
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:48,759
Mind your own business.

438
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Yes, sir.

439
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:56,160
You can even bring it
if you go out to dinner later too.

440
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,319
-See? Like this.
-What are you doing?

441
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:03,359
A big brand sent me a bag
for a review, Uncle Seen.

442
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:06,559
Prim is the first person
to carry this bag.

443
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,280
The brand sent it to her first.

444
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,039
No matter which bag Prim carries,
everyone wants to buy it too.

445
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,079
Do something that earns money.
Don't just do it for recognition.

446
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:33,440
Prom.

447
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:38,159
Have you annoyed your uncle?
Is that why he took it out on your sister?

448
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,960
I only figured out what he's doing.

449
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,039
Mom, don't you think it's odd
that suddenly, he wants Khim to date men?

450
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,920
Men? Men like whom, Prom?

451
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,559
Uncle Seen is usually overprotective.

452
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,920
Tantai, the son of the bank owner.

453
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,599
Tantai and Saikhim?

454
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,360
So, for some reason,
Uncle Seen is accumulating capital.

455
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,199
What do you think, Mom?

456
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,519
If he's using his daughter as bait,
this project must be very special.

457
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:13,320
An immature girl like Khim?
She's not Tan's type.

458
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,079
Uncle Seen thinks too highly of her.

459
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,679
That's right.

460
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,880
If it were you, Prim, it would make sense.

461
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,400
Seen has made the wrong move this time.

462
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,360
I don't understand.

463
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,400
Why does Uncle Seen always criticize me
and compare me to Saikhim?

464
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:30,480
She's such a nerd.
Who would want to be her?

465
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,719
I think you should show Uncle Seen
just what a loser his daughter is.

466
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,159
She looks innocent,

467
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,519
but brazenly takes everything from us.

468
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:44,360
If your father hadn't died,

469
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,159
that girl would never have inherited.

470
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:50,159
I will show everyone.

471
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:52,599
I have something good of my own to offer.

472
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,119
Uncle Seen underestimates me
as much as he overestimates Khim.

473
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:01,639
Saikhim is a good student,
but she's no more than that.

474
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:05,719
If she weren't a VIP's daughter,
she would leave no mark on this world.

475
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,239
You're right.

476
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:16,440
Where's my sketchbook?

477
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:24,599
I must have left it at that guy's house.

478
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,159
I bet you
that your girlfriend didn't fly anywhere.

479
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:08,039
That's why her luggage is here.
She only ran off with another guy.

480
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:09,639
She's cheating on you.

481
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,239
Damn it.

482
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:23,760
Miss?

483
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:40,679
I'm here to see Saikhim.

484
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:45,159
I'm not sure if Khim has left yet.

485
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:50,199
Khim?

486
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:54,639
She must have gone to see her instructor
about her presentation.

487
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:57,639
So, what now? Sir…

488
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:00,199
would you like to wait here?

489
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,360
Or should I give her your message?

490
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:19,039
Who are you, miss?

491
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,719
Yeah… sorry. I forgot to introduce myself.

492
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,480
Would you like to sit down first?

493
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,400
I'm a friend of Saikhim's from Thailand.

494
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,880
My name is…

495
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:39,800
I'm Manta.

496
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,519
I just wanted to have a holiday here,
so I asked Khim if I could stay here.

497
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,679
And your name is…

498
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,800
I'm Tantai.

499
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,199
I'm a postgraduate student,
and I'm a bit older than Saikhim.

500
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,559
Right. You're Tantai, of course.

501
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,199
That makes sense.

502
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:01,840
You've heard of me?

503
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,400
Of course I have.

504
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,880
I mean, Saikhim told me herself

505
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,159
that the two of you study here together.

506
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,519
Would you like a drink? I'll get you one.

507
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,360
What should I do now?

508
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:39,199
Gla!

509
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,159
Gla.

510
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,880
They're getting married today.

511
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,239
Yamsom left you to get married.

512
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,000
When she's with you, she's Yamsom.

513
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,119
When she's with this rich guy,
she's known as Noeysod.

514
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:58,960
That means she has a secret account.

515
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:02,840
She pretends to get on flights
to live as someone you don't know.

516
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,480
She's not just two-faced.

517
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:08,239
It's like she has two bodies
that swap lives.

518
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,119
What is this crazy nonsense?

519
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:15,719
Life is so hard.

520
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,400
Should we crash their wedding?

521
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:46,000
We have a little problem.

522
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,360
The bank said Miss Khim's credit cards
may not have been hacked.

523
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,199
They were physically used
to buy things in Thailand.

524
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,719
But how? Khim hasn't come back here yet.

525
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:57,599
It's possible

526
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:00,039
that Miss Khim is here now, sir.

527
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,000
While Auntie Oonruean was away,
Miss Khim may have seized her chance

528
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,000
to come to Thailand ahead of schedule.

529
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,760
I'll have our people find her.

530
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:09,599
Call Tantai right now.

531
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:17,400
Isn't Auntie Oon here?

532
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,159
Auntie Oon went home.

533
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:22,440
-Her nephew's getting ordained.
-How do you know Saikhim?

534
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:23,800
And since when?

535
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,039
High school.

536
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,159
Are you a student?

537
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:28,480
Yes, at Silpakorn.

538
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:30,760
Have you spent much time with Khim?

539
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,440
We've known each other
since the tenth grade.

540
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,760
Is it possible?

541
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:44,440
She doesn't have a friend called Manta.

542
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:47,719
I'll get the police to go there now.

543
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,199
So where is Saikhim now?

544
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,840
I hope this is not an abduction.

545
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:06,239
This woman's name is Lita.

546
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,920
She just got a visitor visa.

547
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,559
She's been here a couple of days.

548
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:11,280
Where is Saikhim now?

549
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:15,199
She's in Thailand.

550
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,599
She said she's going home.

551
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,159
So Saikhim was at your place last night?

552
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:24,760
The two of us just wanted to travel,

553
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,840
just for a change of scenery.

554
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,719
We didn't do anything untoward.

555
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,880
If she just wanted to travel,
why did she lie to her family?

556
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:37,639
Sir, if Saikhim asked for your permission,
you would not have given it.

557
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:39,280
It's true, isn't it?

558
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:56,440
Hey. Lita.

559
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,360
It's about time you called.

560
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:04,559
Khim, your whole family knows

561
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:06,159
that you're in Thailand.

562
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,719
You lost your credit cards, right?

563
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,280
Come home right now. It's all over.

564
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,519
You know you can't be calm anymore, right?

565
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:54,440
-I know.
-I care about you so much, Gla.

566
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:56,440
Think about it. I investigated it for you.

567
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,920
Which way, bro?

568
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:05,519
This way.

569
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,280
Hey.

570
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,360
There, bro.

571
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,760
Do you believe me now?

572
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,079
Their pre-wedding photos are everywhere.

573
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:26,639
This is a huge wedding.

574
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:28,800
Your girlfriend is clearly a gold digger.

575
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:31,360
She's totally disrespected you.

576
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,239
She must think you're stupid,
so she cheated on you like this

577
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,920
while you were blinded by love.

578
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:38,000
Hey. Look, bro.

579
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,280
Hey.

580
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,639
That's too damn much.

581
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:47,639
It's like she thinks you're worthless.

582
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:49,679
Don't just stay calm.

583
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,480
Sir.

584
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:00,280
May I get my stuff
from your girlfriend's place?

585
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:03,719
I left some stuff
at your bride-to-be's place.

586
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:05,639
Can I go and get it?

587
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,400
There's nothing there.

588
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,760
What do you mean? Of course it's there.

589
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,119
The bride-to-be and the home,
they're gone now.

590
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,079
Nothing is real anymore.

591
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,199
Who is my girlfriend, then?

592
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,960
I don't even know her real name.

593
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:20,239
Hey, Gla.

594
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,719
I only know she is awful.

595
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:24,079
Promiscuous.

596
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:26,079
Greedy.

597
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,039
Shameless.

598
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,920
-Where is she? Find her.
-Hey, Gla.

599
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,320
-Bro.
-Sir, what's wrong?

600
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,920
-Bro.
-Just calm down first.

601
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:35,639
Calm down?

602
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:37,559
Try having a rude awakening too.

603
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,559
I said, fetch the bride.

604
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,800
Fetch the bride if you don't want me
to trash this place any more.

605
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:49,559
Didn't you hear me? Go on.

606
00:45:56,559 --> 00:45:57,920
Is that your girlfriend?

607
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,840
Yeah.

608
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:00,840
She ran off to marry him.

609
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,000
Are you happy now?

610
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,039
-I'm an idiot.
-Gla.

611
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,559
-Gla.
-I didn't see through her.

612
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:09,960
-Come on, Gla.
-That's how she fooled me. Let go.

613
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,320
Go on. Tell me I deserve it.

614
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:25,199
Hey.

615
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:26,679
Gla.

616
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:30,159
Hey, mister.

617
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:33,719
-That's enough.
-Enough?

618
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,239
Please stop.

619
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,920
Hey, mister!

620
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:50,960
Don't hurt him.

621
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,880
He just came to take back what's his.

622
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,760
Sir.

623
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,960
Please just leave.

624
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,239
Don't stir up trouble here.

625
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,840
I know…

626
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,840
that you're a good person.

627
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,840
Hey, watch out!

628
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:31,119
You're just very upset, that's all.

629
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,159
Hey.

630
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:40,920
Sir.

631
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:48,840
There have been worse days,

632
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:51,159
and you've gotten through them.

633
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:55,280
You didn't survive just to hurt someone.

634
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,480
What doesn't kill us…

635
00:48:03,639 --> 00:48:06,159
will make us stronger, you know?

636
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:10,440
Believe me.

637
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:22,880
Let's go.

638
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,039
Here I am.
Is bridal makeup on the fourth floor?

639
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,280
I'm on my way there.

640
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:43,760
Who the hell is that?

641
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,920
Here I am.
Is bridal makeup on the fourth floor?

642
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,119
I'm on my way there.

643
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:04,559
I think I know

644
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:06,079
why Saikhim is back here.

645
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,559
Saikhim is using dating apps

646
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:16,800
and planning to meet men she talks to.

647
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,559
I contacted the app.

648
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:22,199
They agreed to send us
a list of men she's talked to.

649
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:27,679
Here it is.

650
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,440
These are the men
Saikhim came back to meet.

651
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:40,440
Isn't it strange

652
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,679
that Mr. Sansern didn't know of this?

653
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,360
That's him.

654
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,360
Is my dad still here?

655
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:19,639
He's going to be so mad at you.

656
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,960
-Dad?
-Where have you been?

657
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:34,440
I've just been staying
at a friend's house, Dad.

658
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:42,920
Since when did you lie to me?

659
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,679
I just wanted to try living
in a way I haven't done before.

660
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,960
By sleeping around with men?

661
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,880
I didn't do that.

662
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:56,280
I didn't come back
to meet anyone, I swear.

663
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,440
Can you swear
that you don't know these men?

664
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:01,199
Can you swear it?

665
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:10,159
Why have you been so irresponsible?

666
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:12,599
Dad, you don't understand.

667
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:14,960
Just look at yourself.

668
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:19,599
You stink of alcohol.

669
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:23,320
How dare you bring a man here
to cause trouble?

670
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,280
How could you?

671
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,239
You didn't even ask me
what I've been through.

672
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,760
What did I do that was so wrong

673
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,320
that you think
I'm some sort of delinquent?

674
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,440
If you weren't skanky like your mom…

675
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:40,760
you would never dare disobey me like this.

676
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,880
You know very well

677
00:51:43,719 --> 00:51:46,039
that I hate women like your mom the most.

678
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,000
But I'm not Mom.

679
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,000
Don't you dare talk back.

680
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,480
Don't you love me anymore, Dad?

681
00:51:56,519 --> 00:51:57,920
Act like someone I can love.

682
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:03,000
I have to do everything
the way you want me to.

683
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:05,239
That's why I feel smothered.

684
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,000
When I want to do something just for me,

685
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:09,639
you can't stand it.

686
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,280
I've never crossed
the boundaries you created.

687
00:52:15,159 --> 00:52:18,119
I've tried to do everything
to put you at ease.

688
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:21,880
But you still don't trust me.

689
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:28,000
I guess I can't always be
your good little girl.

690
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,840
Gla.

691
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:47,960
You said you had to get on a flight,
but you're really here.

692
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,400
Clever, aren't you?

693
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,239
Why are you so scared now?

694
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,639
Hey. Who the hell are you?

695
00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:57,360
I'm your bride's boyfriend.

696
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,440
It's not true.

697
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:04,599
The last time she got on a flight,
she spent time as my girlfriend.

698
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:06,840
This time, she got on a flight,

699
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,559
and she swapped shifts
to become your bride.

700
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,599
What the hell do you mean?

701
00:53:12,679 --> 00:53:15,079
She intentionally cheated on us both.

702
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,039
-Why did you make me wait?
-Who waited for whom?

703
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:22,599
I was the one
who had to wait for you to have a future.

704
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,960
I stayed with you

705
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:26,320
because I pitied you.

706
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:30,480
Without me, you would still be in hell.

707
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:31,639
Wait.

708
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,280
Hey.

709
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,159
Don't say you've been seeing him, Noey.

710
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:38,159
I wanted to dump him every day.

711
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:39,760
But I didn't do it

712
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,719
because I couldn't do another bad deed.

713
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,400
Just say you love his money.

714
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,800
Can you look after me like he can?

715
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,519
Go. Get out.

716
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:51,320
All right. I'll go.

717
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,760
Here's a parting gift.

718
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,239
-Darling.
-Never forget that you stole her from me.

719
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,039
Damn you.

720
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:01,440
Hey, Gla, watch out!

721
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:04,840
Don't hurt my bro.

722
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,280
-Darling?
-Gla, let's go now.

723
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,079
-Bro, hurry.
-Darling?

724
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:15,119
Khem.

725
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:26,719
Gla, that way.

726
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:28,920
-Stop!
-Hey!

727
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,719
Hey.

728
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:44,119
-Let me come with you.
-No!

729
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,199
That's my blazer.

730
00:56:58,639 --> 00:56:59,480
Miss Khim!

731
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:05,440
Can you really drive?

732
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:11,760
I just wanted to try living
in a way I haven't done before.

733
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,519
By sleeping around with men?

734
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,639
Why have you been so irresponsible?

735
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,079
Why are you going so fast?

736
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:28,519
Stop.

737
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:30,840
If you weren't skanky like your mom,

738
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:34,079
you would never dare disobey me like this.

739
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,000
Hey.

740
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,280
There's a motorcycle.

741
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,840
Be careful!

742
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,519
You could kill someone.

743
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:51,639
Can you swear it?

744
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,880
-Are you okay?
-Don't you dare talk back.

745
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,400
Miss?

746
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:03,760
The sidewalk!

747
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,039
That's enough. Stop right there.

748
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,719
I'm sorry.

749
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,320
You can't drive. Why did you?

750
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:49,360
I…

751
00:58:50,679 --> 00:58:52,079
I just wanted to get away.

752
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:54,079
Get away or kill us both?

753
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:02,840
Mister… are you hurt at all?

754
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,840
Just in my heart.

755
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,280
I shouldn't have trusted
such a brat with my life.

756
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:17,719
I'm sorry.

757
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,639
I can pay for the repairs, okay?

758
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,559
Can you afford it?
Do you know how much these cost?

759
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,719
I'll pay for the repairs.

760
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:34,480
Easy to say.

761
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,159
How can you afford it? Huh?

762
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:40,920
I can manage it.

763
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,159
Can you give me some time?

764
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:07,079
See you at the garage.

765
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:16,239
I…

766
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,880
Give me time to find the money.

767
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:19,960
I won't accept any.

768
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,679
Don't bother finding the money.

769
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,679
Get your stuff from my place.

770
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:31,599
Just go. I don't care where.

771
01:00:58,039 --> 01:00:58,920
Wake up, Saikhim.

772
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,199
Time to review your lessons.

773
01:01:05,719 --> 01:01:07,599
You haven't finished these exercises.

774
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:10,199
I said, don't make the same error.

775
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:11,719
Is it really correct?

776
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,039
Give me your hand.
This way, you'll remember.

777
01:01:19,639 --> 01:01:21,760
Miss Khim, tomorrow's a holiday.

778
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,880
-Do you want to go somewhere?
-I want to go to the amusement park.

779
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,440
Say hello to your father.

780
01:01:31,639 --> 01:01:34,039
Do it again, honey.
And bend your knees nicely.

781
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:37,880
I got an art tutor to come tomorrow.

782
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,199
Your ballet class is in the evening.

783
01:01:48,679 --> 01:01:52,039
Horseback riding is in the morning,
as usual, and piano is in the evening.

784
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:56,159
After your English tutoring session today,
I want you to start French.

785
01:01:56,239 --> 01:01:59,280
You're too talented
to let something like this slide.

786
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:05,480
I don't want you
to go to school with boys.

787
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:07,840
I'm moving you
to a girls' school next term.

788
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,599
Get ready to go study in England.

789
01:02:09,679 --> 01:02:12,719
I've picked a school for you.
I'm sure you'll love it.

790
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:13,840
Fill in these forms.

791
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:33,599
It's Miss Saikhim.

792
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,760
-What is it?
-Dad?

793
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,880
Could you please just trust me for once?

794
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,760
If you help me out this time,

795
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,519
I'll come home to you right away.

796
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:52,719
Help you with what?

797
01:02:53,719 --> 01:02:54,800
Prove to me

798
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,039
that you still care about me.

799
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,760
If you really love me,

800
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,199
can you send me, say, a million baht?

801
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,159
Did a con man make you do this?

802
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,159
Investigate this.

803
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,239
Find out who he is.

804
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:31,280
I don't want
a single picture of her in this house.

805
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,039
Hey, sweetheart.

806
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:23,960
Wanna come with me?

807
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,280
Where to?

808
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:38,840
Hey, mister!

809
01:04:40,599 --> 01:04:41,880
Don't hurt him.

810
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,320
He just came to take back what's his.

811
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:48,039
How much?

812
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,920
How much? What do you mean?

813
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,960
Is this enough for you?

814
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:19,800
-Come here right now.
-Hey!

815
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:23,000
We're making a deal. What's your problem?

816
01:05:24,199 --> 01:05:25,320
How much are you paying?

817
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,719
You think you can just buy anyone?

818
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,079
Who the hell do you think you are?

819
01:05:33,159 --> 01:05:34,079
Take this!

820
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,719
Don't hurt him, please. He's with me.

821
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:41,239
I see.

822
01:05:42,199 --> 01:05:44,199
You really are just a prostitute.

823
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,239
You work to feed this man.

824
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,400
As for you,

825
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,400
you're just a good-for-nothing pimp.

826
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,159
Two pieces of filthy trash.

827
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,480
A perfect pair.

828
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:56,920
Trash.

829
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,880
I told you not to find the money.
Why would you debase yourself for me?

830
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:16,599
Tens, or hundreds,
or millions of baht aren't worth that.

831
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,400
Don't wait for him to come back. Come on.

832
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,079
Dad, please trust me.

833
01:07:05,079 --> 01:07:06,519
And I promise you,

834
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:08,599
I'll come back to you right away.

835
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:10,079
You messed up.

836
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:12,440
You don't get to negotiate.

837
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:16,119
So you're really giving up on me.

838
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,400
In the end,

839
01:07:21,719 --> 01:07:24,639
I'm worth less than that money, aren't I?

840
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,679
If you still care about me,

841
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:33,440
please prove it
by sending me that money tonight, okay?

842
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,480
SAIKHIM

843
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,399
Miss?

844
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:41,000
That's enough for today.
I'm taking her home.

845
01:08:41,079 --> 01:08:42,000
Of course, sir.

846
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,039
Hey, mister!

847
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,560
SANSERN

848
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,840
I found out that man's name.
It's Gaogla Chayodom, sir.

849
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:09,720
I have his address.

850
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,640
Shall I go and get Miss Saikhim, Mr. Seen?

851
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:13,560
Don't bother.

852
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:16,760
I want to test her.

853
01:09:18,199 --> 01:09:19,239
Between me

854
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:20,960
and that man,

855
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:23,920
whom will Saikhim choose?

856
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,760
Leave the keys and just get out of here.

857
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:05,720
I don't have the money
for your repairs yet.

858
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,359
Can I owe you for now?

859
01:11:08,439 --> 01:11:10,840
-But I promise--
-I told you not to pay.

860
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:12,479
How could you afford it?

861
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,279
Look, I know I'm worthless.

862
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,199
Even your car is worth more than me now.

863
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,560
Who'd value you when you're like this?

864
01:11:26,319 --> 01:11:28,039
If you keep seeking casual encounters,

865
01:11:28,119 --> 01:11:29,520
you'll never be truly happy.

866
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:33,359
Even people who have had
relationships for years like me

867
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,359
don't truly know each other.

868
01:11:36,199 --> 01:11:37,680
Strangers are even worse.

869
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:41,079
No one is sincere. Just stop looking.

870
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:45,520
I don't expect others to love me.

871
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,279
Even my own father can't love me.

872
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:52,560
They say your parents love you

873
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,560
without you asking them to.

874
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,600
Maybe it's not always true.

875
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:58,840
What do you mean?

876
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,439
If we love somebody,

877
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,800
and we have to try this hard,

878
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,000
it's too unfair, right?

879
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,760
If we try to do good deeds all our lives,

880
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:14,960
and we fail just one time,

881
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:18,319
why can't we forgive each other?

882
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,760
Maybe this is not what love is.

883
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,079
He cares more about money
than he does about me.

884
01:12:26,119 --> 01:12:27,920
I guess I really am worthless.

885
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,439
Hey.

886
01:12:54,319 --> 01:12:55,399
Do you like that?

887
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,920
I've seen you do it.

888
01:13:06,079 --> 01:13:07,359
Do you feel better?

889
01:13:12,039 --> 01:13:13,760
I'm sorry that I'm being dramatic.

890
01:13:14,439 --> 01:13:15,279
It's okay.

891
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,439
If it makes you feel better, do it.

892
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:20,800
The kindness of strangers, eh?

893
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:55,560
It does feel nice.

894
01:14:01,079 --> 01:14:04,920
Since doing good deeds got us nowhere,
let's just drink to forget this madness.

895
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,039
If we drink,

896
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:17,760
will we really forget all about it?

897
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,640
At least it'll make
this awful day go faster.

898
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,560
Take it easy. Take small sips.

899
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:51,560
Take small sips.

900
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,439
I'm sorry.

901
01:16:22,039 --> 01:16:24,439
When I have the money, I'll fix you.

902
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,199
Get well soon.

903
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:40,760
And

904
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:42,880
forgive me.

905
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:44,800
I'm sorry.

906
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:48,479
Hey.

907
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:50,760
What are you doing?

908
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,199
Are you hurt?

909
01:17:05,239 --> 01:17:06,880
You… Here.

910
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:13,720
Wait. I'll… I'll stick a bandage on you.

911
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,399
I'll put it where it hurts.

912
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:19,640
There.

913
01:17:20,359 --> 01:17:22,479
I've put the bandage on you.

914
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:24,760
Leave it there.

915
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,760
It will heal your broken heart soon.

916
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:40,960
Does it still hurt?

917
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,520
No. But I'm hungry.

918
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,439
There's nothing left.

919
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,319
We're going to starve.

920
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,159
We won't starve.

921
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:05,840
-We are not going to starve.
-What?

922
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,079
We can survive on this for now.

923
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:24,760
It's the sweet roti you paid for.

924
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:27,680
Take it.

925
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:36,159
The kindness we show to others

926
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:37,760
will one day

927
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,600
be shown to us too.

928
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:45,640
You're a good person.

929
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,760
You'll never starve.

930
01:19:26,119 --> 01:19:27,039
I'm a good person?

931
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:29,119
How do you know I am?

932
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:35,720
Come here.

933
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:41,920
Come on.

934
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:51,319
The roti vendor told me

935
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:54,479
that you lived hand to mouth
through hard times.

936
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:59,479
When you made money,
you wanted to share it with others,

937
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:03,000
so you paid for the sweet roti upfront

938
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,560
in case there were people who needed them.

939
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:11,239
And they'd know that there was someone
who cared about their hardship.

940
01:20:12,119 --> 01:20:13,199
When I heard that,

941
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,079
I was so impressed.

942
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,800
You have a heart of gold.

943
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:23,760
What? Heart of gold?
I barely did anything.

944
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,680
That's not all.

945
01:20:29,119 --> 01:20:29,960
There's more?

946
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,840
You've saved my life twice.

947
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:35,640
So you're saving mine?

948
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:37,680
No.

949
01:20:40,119 --> 01:20:41,119
I know

950
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:43,800
that when someone you love hurts you,

951
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,439
it hurts so much.

952
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,920
Don't stir up trouble here.

953
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:54,039
I know

954
01:20:54,119 --> 01:20:55,680
that you're a good person.

955
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,399
You're just very upset, that's all.

956
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,600
There have been worse days,

957
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:04,560
and you've gotten through them.

958
01:21:05,079 --> 01:21:07,640
You didn't survive just to hurt someone.

959
01:21:09,159 --> 01:21:10,439
What doesn't kill us

960
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,920
will make us stronger.

961
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,600
One day, your ex will realize

962
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:26,439
that she had a good thing
in her life but lost it.

963
01:21:27,439 --> 01:21:30,199
You only lost someone you loved.

964
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:34,880
But she… she lost someone who loved her.

965
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,680
She's the one who will be sorry.

966
01:21:50,359 --> 01:21:51,199
So delicious.

967
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:55,159
So finish it.

968
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:02,600
Let's split it.

969
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:05,000
We starved together,
so we should feast together.

970
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:09,479
You eat it. Don't go hungry.

971
01:22:31,359 --> 01:22:33,279
Your life is worth more than that car.

972
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,880
You can't compare that stuff to your life.

973
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:40,560
Don't sacrifice yourself
for worthless stuff again.

974
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:41,479
Got it?

975
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,319
Don't let anyone make you feel worthless.

976
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,720
Don't cry.

977
01:23:21,239 --> 01:23:22,840
Whoever dares to make you cry

978
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:24,840
is very cruel.

979
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:41,479
Watch out!

980
01:24:17,239 --> 01:24:18,840
If he's such a good person,

981
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,199
why was he in juvenile detention?

982
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,319
Who are you talking about?

983
01:24:23,399 --> 01:24:24,800
Hey.

984
01:24:25,479 --> 01:24:29,199
The cops accused me
of luring and assaulting you.

985
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,720
So you came here to harass me?

986
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,000
Hey!

987
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:40,359
What's so good about him
that you can't resist?

988
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:44,119
What did I do wrong
to make you turn out like this?

989
01:24:44,199 --> 01:24:46,000
Saikhim didn't know I followed her.

990
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,840
You're letting Prom kill him?

991
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,720
Dad, tell him to stop!

992
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:56,199
When he humiliated me, you didn't care.

993
01:25:27,159 --> 01:25:31,600
