00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,400
THIS FICTIONAL SERIES IS INTENDED
FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY

2
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,719
It's not an award, Khim.

3
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,280
It's a punishment for us both.

4
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,520
If you want to get revenge on me,
leave other people out of it.

5
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,439
This is Rarin.

6
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,439
Rarin?

7
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,800
But everyone said that my mom died.

8
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,759
Your dad wouldn't let us see each other.

9
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,039
Dad, explain to me
what the hell is going on!

10
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,759
She was the one who left me and you first!

11
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,759
You want to hurt me?

12
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,280
If you do, you've succeeded.
I'm in pain. Are you happy now?

13
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,719
-So let's get divorced.
-Give me your shares if you wanna remarry.

14
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,439
You wanted to flirt with your man?

15
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,479
Sorry.

16
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,479
I'm the wrong one.

17
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:19,719
I don't know what happened
between you and him.

18
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,000
But I think

19
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,000
it's for the best

20
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,960
that you're trying to stay away from him.

21
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,400
WHEN THERE ARE DIFFERENCES…

22
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,199
If you hate each other,
you still care about each other.

23
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,960
If there's no love left,

24
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,039
even if you see each other,

25
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,680
you'll feel nothing.

26
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,120
I want him to get what he wants

27
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,240
to prove we no longer have
feelings for each other.

28
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,800
Hello?

29
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,879
Your dad asked to see me today.

30
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,319
He's very worried about the graft probe.

31
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,879
Really?

32
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,319
So… any updates on the divorce?

33
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,360
Did he use your dad's case as leverage?

34
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,680
It's gone nowhere yet.
It probably won't be easy.

35
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:13,120
What? So what will you do now?

36
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,759
If he tries playing dirty…

37
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,439
I will too.

38
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,680
Hello?

39
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,720
WOMAN OF THE YEAR, MS. LITA THONGMA

40
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,360
How did this get here?

41
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,240
Mom!

42
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,600
-Mom!
-What?

43
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,800
What is it?

44
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,480
Where did you get this award?

45
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:53,600
That? Saikhim's partner sent it to us.
You broke it, you clumsy girl?

46
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,959
You're lucky he fixed it.

47
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,439
-But Mr. Seen said…
-I said no!

48
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,639
As for Mr. Songseen,

49
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,399
tell him to go to hell!

50
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,879
Tanthai knows I want it,
so he sent it to us.

51
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:14,839
And this photo album,

52
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,199
he sent me it as a gift
to show off to everyone with.

53
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:23,120
He said he wanted me to be proud of you.

54
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,079
I understand now
why Saikhim chose to marry this man.

55
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,680
It's because he's so sweet and so nice.

56
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,120
He saw that I was upset
about not being invited to the event,

57
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,959
so he sent me photos
and videos that he took himself

58
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,399
to make me feel better.

59
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,120
Where are you going?
Accept your award first.

60
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,680
Hi, Ms. Lita. Come on.

61
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,000
Congratulations.

62
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:55,399
Let's get a photo together.
Another round of applause, please!

63
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,839
It's kind of a pity.

64
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:09,000
I wish I had such a perfect son-in-law.

65
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,680
Jeez, what good deeds did Saikhim do
to deserve such a catch?

66
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,000
He's so great!

67
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,079
Mom, why is your daughter so unlucky?

68
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,920
Auntie Oon?

69
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,519
What? You're back, Miss Khim?

70
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,680
Are you hungry?

71
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,839
Have you eaten?

72
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,519
Yes, I have.

73
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,879
Hey.

74
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,480
-But how come…
-Auntie Oon.

75
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,720
You should go to bed.
Don't worry about me.

76
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,639
All right.

77
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,680
What? Miss Khim?

78
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,600
You need anything? You should've called.

79
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:44,759
I just wanted to see
if you were asleep yet.

80
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,399
I wanted to hear you snoring
before I fall asleep.

81
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,000
Aw, Miss Khim.

82
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,439
Today,

83
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,480
I went to see my mom.

84
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,839
She was with her new daughter.

85
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,439
I felt jealous of them
because they seem so close.

86
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,759
But

87
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,399
I really wanted to brag

88
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,399
that while she has a new daughter,
I have you too, Auntie Oon.

89
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,199
I shouldn't even feel upset

90
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,799
that someone stole my mom

91
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,279
because

92
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,320
I stole you
from your daughter too, Auntie Oon.

93
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,159
Thank you for staying here with me.

94
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,559
Though I don't have everyone,

95
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,080
you never make me feel
like someone's missing.

96
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm so lucky to have you, Auntie Oon.

97
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,519
-Next…
-Say hello to Madame.

98
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,720
-Hello, Madame.
-Well, hello, dear.

99
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,919
-Come on.
-Come on in, dear.

100
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,799
Listen, my dear.

101
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,600
This girl here,

102
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,240
that boy, Carl, found her for me
to help me type up my recipe book.

103
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,159
These kids are volunteers.

104
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,879
They come and work for me

105
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,000
in exchange for my food.

106
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,279
They don't often get to eat
good, nutritious food.

107
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,960
Now, look over there.

108
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,399
That group there, cutting the grass,

109
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,240
they're helping me out

110
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,840
in exchange for a meal.

111
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,759
Actually, this Arsa app that Carl made,

112
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,080
it really is good, dear.

113
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,679
Gosh, it's made my life much easier.

114
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:05,200
You know how they say
that technology makes people unkind?

115
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,639
I don't think that's true at all.
I'll argue with anyone who thinks that.

116
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,840
This thing has made society
so much better, my dear.

117
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,039
You know, I think Carl is very talented.

118
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:23,559
He can do anything he dreams of.
I'm a big fan of his work.

119
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,399
But everyone who comes here

120
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,320
wants something in return, don't they?

121
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,840
Yes, dear.

122
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:34,200
But when Carl comes
to sit there and work every day,

123
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,279
I like that.

124
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,840
It's like he's come to keep me company.

125
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:42,360
And it stops me from feeling lonely.

126
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,840
Well, isn't that nice?

127
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,240
And what if one day,

128
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,320
he doesn't want to just work here,

129
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:52,039
but… he wants to come here to make money?

130
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:55,159
How would he make money?
I don't understand.

131
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,559
I have to go back for a meeting.

132
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,879
-I see.
-I'll come again another day.

133
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,799
Of course.

134
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:04,320
I think you should take all this with you
and eat some, all right?

135
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,519
I'll have Chor wrap this up for you.

136
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,919
It won't take long.

137
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,519
-Chor!
-Yes, ma'am.

138
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,559
Come over here.

139
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:16,559
Take all this
and wrap it up nicely for her.

140
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,679
Hurry up.

141
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,600
Yes, ma'am.

142
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,840
Good. Yes, wrap it up nicely.

143
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,080
I want you to see the truth.

144
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,279
I'm sorry it has to be like this.

145
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,720
-Chor?
-It's ready, ma'am.

146
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,120
My goodness!

147
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,600
-So impatient.
-So slow.

148
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,879
-Here.
-Give me that.

149
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,519
Here, dear.

150
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,000
Take it and taste your own cooking.

151
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,799
Go on, dear. All right.
Bye, dear. Go ahead.

152
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,519
Wait. Hold on a minute.

153
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,639
Did someone forget
to take something with them?

154
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,720
What thing?

155
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:14,799
What is it?

156
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:20,120
Well, this must belong to Carl.
He'll probably come back for it.

157
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,720
May I see?

158
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,320
But that's the plan of this house.

159
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,039
What? Let me see.

160
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,679
Be careful.

161
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:02,519
Carl, is this yours, dear?

162
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,159
-Where did you find it?
-Don't you dare ask!

163
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:10,799
You come here every day,

164
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,559
hoping to turn it into a hotel, don't you?

165
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,440
That's not it.

166
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,480
Of course it is!

167
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,000
We thought you came here
with good intentions,

168
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,720
but you just want to make a profit!

169
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,240
No wonder you helped us
deal with the expropriation!

170
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:27,720
Chor!

171
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,200
Carl, if you want to take this property

172
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,120
and turn it into a hotel,

173
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,559
I'll give it to you.

174
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,759
Madame!

175
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,600
What? I told you to be calm.

176
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,840
But please wait until I'm dead first.

177
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,559
Once I've died…

178
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,039
Give me that!

179
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,440
I'll change my will to bequeath
this land and this house to you, Carl,

180
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,240
because I don't have
any kids or grandkids anyway.

181
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,399
But I need one thing from you, Carl.

182
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,320
I'd like you to take
a portion of the hotel's profits

183
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,720
and give it to Chor here, dear.

184
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,399
Who'd accept your money, Madame?

185
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,159
Come on now.

186
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,080
But I don't want
to take your house, Auntie.

187
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,960
Carl,

188
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,720
I want to give it to you because I know
that you know that this land

189
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,720
has some value,
and you'll use it to do something good.

190
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,919
If it were someone else,

191
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,799
I wouldn't trust them at all.

192
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,240
Consider it my dying wish, my dear.

193
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,600
I don't need to keep it.

194
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,759
But I do worry about one thing.

195
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,879
I'm worried about Chor here.

196
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,000
All right, dear?

197
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,000
Don't cry.

198
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,240
Did it get here because of the other day?

199
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:03,799
Make him read them.

200
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:05,399
I want his answer today!

201
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,159
That day, I couldn't find the designs.

202
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,600
I thought I'd lost them,
but they ended up here.

203
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,039
Because you didn't divorce her.

204
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,000
I think you should sign
her divorce agreement soon

205
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,600
before Madame Asia takes
your company and shares back.

206
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:29,000
So she's playing hardball.

207
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,039
Hey.

208
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,639
She wants to expose us,

209
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,759
so I'll leak the marriage certificate.

210
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,559
Take care of it.

211
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,000
-What?
-What?

212
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,600
-Hey!
-Sorry, we're busy today.

213
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,559
Hey! Where are you going?

214
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:50,759
You won't even say hi?

215
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,759
Maybe next time. This is really urgent.

216
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,159
-Hey, wait!
-Let go!

217
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,360
Hey, you're being so rude!

218
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,240
You messed with me first, Saikhim.

219
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,519
Hey!

220
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,399
What's so urgent?

221
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,240
A divorce agreement?

222
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:26,159
Uncle, did you know
those two signed a marriage certificate?

223
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,879
I thought he was dead!

224
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,799
So I stopped caring.

225
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:32,519
Who drew up this agreement?

226
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,440
Miss Khim must have found a lawyer.
She didn't come to ask me.

227
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,639
If those two are still legally married,

228
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,519
Khim can't get remarried yet!

229
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,720
So that's why
they have to get divorced quietly.

230
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,279
A quiet divorce

231
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,879
without any demands?

232
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:52,679
No way.

233
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,320
He pinned a corruption charge on me.

234
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,759
I'll get the best revenge on him.

235
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,519
What if he makes demands too?

236
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,039
In comparison,

237
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,720
it'll hurt him more than us.

238
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,799
Even that house and land

239
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,680
can be ours again if we want them.

240
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,720
Miss Khim is back.

241
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:14,119
And Mr. Tanthai wants to see you, sir.

242
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,359
I'm asking for permission to marry Khim.

243
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:24,359
We picked an auspicious date,
which is six months away,

244
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,680
so I'd like to ask you
about the bride-price.

245
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,799
That's a huge concern

246
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,799
because I raised my daughter very well.

247
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,000
For my daughter,

248
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:38,319
200 million isn't asking too much.

249
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,599
Two hundred million?

250
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,640
You're kidding, right?

251
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,000
The bride-price should be worthy
of both our families' reputations, right?

252
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,480
Dad?

253
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,839
Two hundred million isn't too much

254
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,240
compared to the opportunities you'd lose.

255
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,559
I believe

256
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,359
there are others
who would dare to pay more.

257
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:12,720
He's acting like
he doesn't want to give you to me.

258
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,839
That's not true.

259
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,799
Did I offend him in some way?

260
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,160
Or is he unhappy

261
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,920
that I didn't bring my family
to speak to him?

262
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,279
I'm an adult now.

263
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,319
I don't have to wait
for Dad to give me away.

264
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,319
Though Dad isn't thrilled,

265
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,759
I'll still marry you.

266
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:40,039
Then I'll find a solution with him
so you two don't fall out over me.

267
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,319
Wait till he's in a better mood,
then we can try again.

268
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:48,640
I should go.

269
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:04,079
What are you trying to do?

270
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,839
Don't you want me to get married?

271
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,000
How can you get married
when you haven't divorced Gaogla?

272
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,839
How did you know?
Don't tell me he told you.

273
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,559
How could you hide
something this big from me?

274
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,640
I caused this problem.

275
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:26,279
So I'll solve it myself.

276
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,160
I'm going to negotiate with him
about the divorce.

277
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,400
Negotiate?

278
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,920
It's not negotiation
if you're divorcing him for free.

279
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:39,440
He almost ruined your whole life!

280
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:42,839
You should at least
get marital property as compensation.

281
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:51,680
The 200 million you want
for lost opportunities

282
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:54,880
is just extortion, isn't it?

283
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,359
As if he'd give me anything.

284
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,519
You're so manipulative.

285
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,759
And we put him through so much.

286
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:05,279
If he gives you nothing,
don't get divorced.

287
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:06,960
Stay married and bleed him.

288
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:10,119
Didn't you hate that he leeched off us?

289
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:13,799
Now you want me to take his money?

290
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,319
I can't help it.

291
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,799
He refused to know his place.

292
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,319
Serves him right!

293
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,640
I'm marrying Tan.

294
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,839
I won't let this
get in the way of our marriage.

295
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,000
You dated Tanthai
without divorcing Gaogla.

296
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,119
It's like you cheated on him all along!

297
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:37,319
You betrayed him so horribly.

298
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Even when all this is settled,
who knows if he'll accept your past!

299
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:46,599
Gaogla already knows you inside out.

300
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,839
You have nothing to lose.

301
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,279
I want this divorce.

302
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,480
I can't live
with that man in my life anymore!

303
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,279
Bro.

304
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,920
The new divorce agreement.
She wants marital property.

305
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:21,039
She wants to bankrupt you now.

306
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,319
So she wants to be this dog's tick.

307
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:27,559
She wants to bleed you dry?
We'll teach her a lesson.

308
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,000
Get her to talk to me face to face.
This has to end today.

309
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,440
You talk like a snob,
but you actually want to bankrupt him?

310
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:50,880
I played no part in this.

311
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,200
Gla sent you a message.

312
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,680
If you want a divorce,
you have to talk face to face,

313
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,799
or file for divorce.

314
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,160
I'm on my way.

315
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:18,079
Are you leaving work? Shall we go now?

316
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:19,759
Right.

317
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,960
Look, I have to go to an event
with the Hotels Association right now.

318
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:26,200
I guess I can't come with you.

319
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:29,680
But didn't we decide
to announce our wedding together?

320
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,319
If you don't come, what will I do?

321
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:36,480
When I'm done,
I'll catch up with you right away.

322
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,359
It's really important.

323
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,480
Khim!

324
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,400
-Yes?
-Then I'll wait at the restaurant.

325
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,559
All right.

326
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,839
Carl, how did you find this place?

327
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,079
It used to be a garage.

328
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm renovating it as a temporary lodging.
I might start renting it out soon.

329
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,519
It's pretty cute.

330
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:25,880
I'm sure your taste is very original.

331
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,839
Do you think you could live here?

332
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,000
If you can, of course I can too.

333
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,559
But I've got some bad news for you.

334
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,759
Mom has some urgent work,
so she can't take the recipe book photos.

335
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,039
And she's flying home tomorrow.

336
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:47,440
Are you mad at her?

337
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,799
She doesn't seem to like me much.

338
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,519
She's usually more approachable than this.
I don't know what she's upset about.

339
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:57,559
I have an idea.

340
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,240
Let's have a farewell dinner with her.

341
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:04,039
You have to get back in her good books,
or you won't be able to face her again.

342
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,039
Tonight?

343
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,920
What? You're flaking tonight?

344
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,680
Yeah, okay.

345
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:16,839
It's better to sort out the divorce first.

346
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,640
Hey, Tan is already here.

347
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,599
Don't worry, Khim.

348
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,599
I'll handle this for you.

349
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:39,960
Is this another dirty trick?

350
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,240
Lita!

351
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,279
Did she say where she went?

352
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,960
No. I thought I'd see her here too.

353
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,880
I thought the bathroom was here.

354
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,519
I'm going to the bathroom!

355
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,440
Call Khim for me.

356
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:23,960
Let's see if she picks up.

357
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:37,920
No answer.

358
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,480
Why has Khim been weird lately?

359
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:44,200
Something fishy is going on.

360
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:47,359
How is it my problem?
Your partner's missing. Blame yourself.

361
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,279
Mr. Ton, you forgot something.

362
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:55,680
Get in there.

363
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,200
-Get in there right now.
-Why?

364
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:01,799
Hey! I'm going to…

365
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:04,640
Hush, Lita!

366
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,079
Ton is out there.

367
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,599
I don't want him to know
we're talking in here.

368
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:12,880
Be quiet.

369
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:22,200
I can't breathe.

370
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:56,359
Are you drunk?

371
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,799
I'm here to finalize the divorce.

372
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,920
You said you wanted nothing,
but now, you want hundreds of millions?

373
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:34,000
My dad sent those divorce papers.
I had nothing to do with them.

374
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:36,559
I came to confirm
I want nothing from the divorce.

375
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,680
You're giving up hundreds of millions
just to marry this guy.

376
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,279
So you really love him?

377
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,480
More than I loved you.

378
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,839
So prove it.

379
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,200
Prove you love him more than yourself,
and I'll divorce you tomorrow.

380
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:53,680
How should I prove it?

381
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:55,440
Stay here like before.

382
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,599
Sleep together once and part ways.

383
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:01,079
You love him enough to be that wicked?

384
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,160
If you love him enough,
you'll sacrifice your dignity.

385
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,039
This isn't about dignity.

386
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,960
You love him too much to betray him?

387
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:17,880
Only evil people would make
disgusting offers like this.

388
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,960
So killing your own child wasn't evil?

389
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,279
What do you mean?

390
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:25,400
When you left me,
you did whatever you dared to.

391
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,799
Your betrayal knew no bounds.
You did all sorts of evil things.

392
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,839
You respect other men more.

393
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:34,279
What do you think I am?
How could you treat me like that?

394
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,680
How do you want me to make it up to you?

395
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:39,839
Just tell me.

396
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,039
I'll do anything but this revolting thing!

397
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:44,440
You threw me in prison
and got rid of the baby.

398
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,319
How can you pay me back
if not with your life?

399
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,440
Who told you I got rid of the baby?

400
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:52,960
My miscarriage was…

401
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,200
it was a tragic accident.

402
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,319
You wrote to me in prison
to ask for a divorce

403
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,359
and told me, didn't you,

404
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,920
that you couldn't be
with a poor man like me?

405
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,839
I miscarried a few days ago.

406
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,440
I couldn't let it be born
to a dad like you.

407
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:08,440
I don't want to sink any lower.

408
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:10,759
Now I know we're too different.

409
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:11,839
You're a narcissist.

410
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,519
You're selfish.

411
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:15,559
You couldn't divorce me, so you killed me.

412
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,480
What do you mean?

413
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,640
Come here.

414
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,920
You didn't dare face me,
so you tried to kill me to get rid of me.

415
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:26,920
Here's the proof.

416
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:30,279
I kept it to remind myself
how much you hated me.

417
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:35,920
I became a problem,
so you signed my treatment refusal form

418
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,559
so they'd let me die

419
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,200
because you were afraid I'd go on
to expose your failures?

420
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:46,400
What are these?
I've never seen them before.

421
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,279
You mean your dad did this too?

422
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,400
Just admit it.

423
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,000
You wanted to kill me

424
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,880
because you couldn't face living with me.

425
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,799
You let me wait for death

426
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,519
so you could go back to being
good old Miss Saikhim.

427
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,759
But I survived.

428
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:04,680
Khim.

429
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:06,039
I heard that during my coma,

430
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,200
my wife betrayed me.

431
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:10,640
And now you're desperate for a divorce

432
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,839
'cause you're afraid
your man won't accept your sordid past

433
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,759
after you pretended to be an angel.

434
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:19,000
And when you lied
about working in the forests

435
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:21,839
while you were doing illegal work,
you betrayed me too.

436
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,720
I was entrapped!

437
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:26,680
Your dad got Khem arrested
and tricked me into saving him

438
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:29,160
to pin charges on me and throw me in jail!

439
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,200
Dad said you sent him photos
to blackmail me.

440
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,400
You didn't want to look after me.
You wanted to blackmail Dad.

441
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:41,319
Every word your dad says is a lie!

442
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,920
If you believe him,

443
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,440
you must think I'm evil beyond redemption.

444
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:49,559
-So you cut me and the baby off!
-I don't know what's true anymore!

445
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,519
If you're not fooling yourself,

446
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:56,599
you know the truth.

447
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,200
For seven whole years,

448
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,079
you've been so relieved I was dead.

449
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,039
That's not true!

450
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:06,079
I missed you every single day.

451
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,039
Never have I seen you feeling happy

452
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,279
that I survived.

453
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,440
If I'm repulsive,

454
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,839
you're even worse,

455
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,480
so you never feel a thing.

456
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:40,240
Just one night

457
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,000
in exchange for a lifetime with him.

458
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,640
Isn't it worth it?

459
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,440
I can't do that to him.

460
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:50,640
Trust me.

461
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,400
You're more shameless than that.

462
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,400
If you hate me,

463
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
why do you harass me?

464
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,759
These things…

465
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,400
don't have to involve love.

466
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,160
Did you forget

467
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,599
how our story began?

468
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,559
You want me to feel guilty
around Tan for the rest of my life?

469
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,039
You want to blackmail me?

470
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,599
If tonight never happened,

471
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,759
I could still blackmail you.

472
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,359
You think you're so noble?

473
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,880
I may be wicked,
but I'm not as evil as that.

474
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,119
Don't you want a divorce?
Why are you playing hard to get?

475
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:14,799
Why are you scared?

476
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:16,720
We're all grown-up now.

477
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,799
If you feel guilty,

478
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,400
it should be because of me, not him.

479
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:24,200
If we're not divorced,

480
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:26,440
we're not hurting anyone else.

481
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,640
You lost your chance.
That's not my problem.

482
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,839
You don't want a divorce.

483
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,359
You just want to mock me.

484
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,400
Maybe he's got business to attend to.

485
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:09,079
Carl isn't usually like this, Mom.

486
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,440
To really get to know someone,
it takes more time than this.

487
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,719
Aren't long-distance relationships
normally like this?

488
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:27,840
I think you shouldn't commit to anything
until you know this man well enough.

489
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,639
-I gotta go.
-Okay.

490
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,119
What was that?

491
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,599
What did they say?

492
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,280
Jeez!

493
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,360
Dude, Lita is so heavy.

494
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:41,599
-Both her drinking and her body are heavy.
-We were overdue for a meetup.

495
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:43,559
-Careful. Gently, dude.
-Mind her head.

496
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:47,679
Sir, I sent you her address.

497
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,159
Jeez.

498
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,079
-Let us know when you get home.
-All right.

499
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:56,880
-Let's go.
-Jeez.

500
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,119
We'll all be home soon.

501
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,400
Is she safe?

502
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,119
Miss? You're home now, miss.

503
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,039
Miss?

504
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:26,760
-What?
-You're home now.

505
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,360
Sir? It's okay. I'll do it.

506
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,400
Lita, wake up. You're home now.

507
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,320
Come on.

508
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,119
Hey, Lita.

509
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:58,360
-Thanks, sir.
-Is she your partner, sir?

510
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,360
Well… yes.

511
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,960
-Please give her this.
-Sure.

512
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,239
Lita, wake up now.

513
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,320
Oops.

514
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,599
Lita.

515
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,039
Open your eyes.

516
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,800
You're being so reckless.

517
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:24,920
Come on. Go inside.

518
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
What? Why are you here?

519
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:32,960
I'm sorry, okay?

520
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:35,239
I didn't mean for that to happen.

521
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,519
Please don't be mad at me, Tan. Please?

522
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:41,639
-Okay?
-Okay.

523
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,079
You're home now.

524
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,119
Are you sure?

525
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:49,559
Hey…

526
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,519
Whoa, you're the sweetest, Tan.

527
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,800
Why wouldn't I love you?

528
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:58,559
Hey. What did you say?

529
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,199
Hey!

530
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,440
You're so nice.

531
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:04,880
How could Khim do that to you?

532
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:09,400
I don't want you to be someone else's.

533
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:15,440
Hey!

534
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,760
Lita! What are you doing?

535
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,079
Come on.

536
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,639
Enough. Lita, get inside.

537
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:40,159
You wrote to me in prison
to ask for a divorce

538
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:42,480
and told me, didn't you,

539
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:45,000
that you couldn't be
with a poor man like me?

540
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:53,639
You're a narcissist. You're selfish.
You couldn't divorce me, so you killed me.

541
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:55,880
-You did this, didn't you?
-Gla!

542
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,960
-Gla!
-Miss Khim.

543
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:59,960
You framed me! Khim, don't listen to him!

544
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I did nothing wrong.

545
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:03,800
You can't pin this on me!

546
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:05,639
They want us apart!

547
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,280
I promised Khim.
Why would I break my promise to her?

548
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:12,079
-Don't mess with us!
-Stay out of this!

549
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:13,000
Stop it!

550
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:14,400
Are you nuts?

551
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:19,639
I became a problem,
so you signed my treatment refusal form

552
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:20,960
so they'd let me die

553
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,199
because you were afraid I'd go on
to expose your failures?

554
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,800
Just admit it.

555
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,440
You wanted to kill me
because you couldn't face living with me.

556
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,920
What the hell's going on?

557
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:34,639
What have I done?

558
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,079
If you feel guilty,

559
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:50,159
it should be because of me, not him.

560
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:51,559
If we're not divorced,

561
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:53,880
we're not hurting anyone else.

562
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,159
How much must you hate me
to do this to me?

563
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:11,440
I just want you
to be unable to love again.

564
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,440
You selfish people don't deserve love.

565
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,239
Ask yourself this.

566
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,000
As a mom, what did you do to your kid?

567
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,599
What do you mean?

568
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,320
You can't love anyone but yourself.

569
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,920
So now you have no one left.

570
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:11,480
Not even your dad.
You think he cares a lot about you.

571
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,239
But he's not honest with you.
He took your mom away from you,

572
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,960
saying only that she wasn't worthy.

573
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:20,039
I guess you know now

574
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:22,639
that it's you who isn't worthy of us.

575
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,280
I didn't mean it.

576
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,079
I didn't mean it!

577
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,800
I didn't mean to betray you.

578
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,719
Miss Khim!

579
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,119
Hello, Miss Khim?

580
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,639
Miss Khim? Hello, Miss Khim?

581
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:45,239
Miss Khim?

582
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:50,760
Miss Khim, is something wrong? Miss Khim?

583
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:02,760
Seven years ago,

584
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:06,320
you put Gla in prison, didn't you?

585
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:09,440
What's wrong this time?

586
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:14,000
When he hanged himself in prison,

587
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,840
You forged my signature
to tell them not to revive him.

588
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,320
You used me to kill him.

589
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,199
How could you do that?

590
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,159
I know everything now!

591
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:34,639
I know why he accuses me of killing him.

592
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:37,719
You took him from me on purpose, right?

593
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,000
If I hadn't done it,

594
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:42,199
you'd still be farming on a hill now!

595
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:44,760
Is that what you want?

596
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,320
Even if my life were ruined,

597
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,360
at least it would be my own life!

598
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:04,360
You want a ruined life, do you?

599
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,639
These past seven years,

600
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:09,280
you've had a good, luxurious life.

601
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,599
Everyone has envied you, haven't they?

602
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:13,840
Did I do the wrong thing?

603
00:44:20,039 --> 00:44:20,880
Tell me.

604
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,199
After all this time,

605
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,360
what about your life made you so unhappy?

606
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:28,639
These past two days,

607
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:30,920
you announced your engagement, didn't you?

608
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,519
Don't blame me.

609
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,880
Even if you could trade your current life
with the one you had then,

610
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,639
when you had a crappy husband,

611
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,960
I guarantee that you'd never trade them!

612
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,960
No one knows what I need better than I do!

613
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,599
If you regret losing him,
don't marry Tanthai!

614
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,039
If you still love him so much,
just don't divorce him!

615
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,119
Is there still anyone left for me to love

616
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:09,199
after all you did to them?

617
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,280
Are you blubbering so much
because your heart's broken?

618
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,320
You took everything away from me!

619
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,199
From Mom to Gla!

620
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,880
Whenever I love someone,

621
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,920
you always take them from my life

622
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,079
so I'm deprived of love
unlike other people!

623
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:30,159
And are those people worth loving?

624
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,159
Don't preach to me, Dad!

625
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,960
Do you know how to love others?

626
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:41,800
If your love were real,
you wouldn't lie to me or control my life.

627
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,639
You wouldn't take
your disappointments out on me.

628
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:47,039
You wouldn't let me become a murderer!

629
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:49,119
Are you done yet?

630
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:53,360
You want to try it, do you?

631
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,079
If you didn't have your dad in your life,

632
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,760
how would you live?

633
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,320
Let's try it.

634
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:07,159
If you didn't even have me,

635
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,880
you're the one

636
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,400
who'd have no one left.

637
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:13,960
Even if you went back to him,

638
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:17,159
he'd never feel the same about you again.

639
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,480
Khim!

640
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:36,519
Khim!

641
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:02,039
Is she your partner, sir?

642
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,440
Well… yes.

643
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,880
-Please give her this.
-Sure.

644
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:17,960
I didn't mean for that to happen.

645
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:20,599
Please don't be mad at me, Tan.

646
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:21,679
Okay.

647
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,519
Whoa, you're the sweetest, Tan.

648
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,400
Why wouldn't I love you?

649
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:40,840
Where did I put it?

650
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:50,320
How did I get home last night?

651
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:06,079
What?

652
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,320
This way, please.

653
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:27,079
What's this?

654
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,960
I'm the one
who should ask you what that is.

655
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:34,199
How could you do this to Saikhim?

656
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:37,119
You had someone follow me?

657
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:38,159
Wasn't it you

658
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,679
who provided evidence
for Gaogla to report me?

659
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,239
You wanna mess with me?

660
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,039
I never wanted to be
a part of your revenge plots!

661
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:49,800
Why did you involve me?

662
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:52,960
I'll give you
one last chance to redeem yourself.

663
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,360
Ruin Saikhim's wedding.

664
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,280
I'm going to swindle Gaogla.

665
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,199
I'll have Saikhim
take marital property from him.

666
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,880
They won't be able to marry.

667
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,880
An ideal result
for backstabbing best friends like you.

668
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,880
Last night, I was just drunk.

669
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,679
We didn't do anything more.

670
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,199
And I've never wanted
to steal my friend's partner.

671
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,119
Really?

672
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,639
I don't think so.

673
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,440
Based on these photos,

674
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,159
you threw yourself at Tanthai.

675
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:32,880
What if I refuse to obey you?

676
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,519
Saikhim will see these photos.

677
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:39,440
And I don't know

678
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:42,159
if she could bear
staying friends with you.

679
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:45,679
Then I'll admit to her

680
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,639
what happened last night.

681
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,159
And then what?

682
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,840
I'd love to know.

683
00:49:53,639 --> 00:49:55,800
How will you look Tanthai in the eye?

684
00:49:56,519 --> 00:49:57,360
Would you dare?

685
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:00,800
You've come this far.

686
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,679
Now go all the way.

687
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,360
Make Tanthai leave Saikhim.

688
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:10,239
Then you get Tanthai.
It's a win-win situation!

689
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,039
Tan doesn't love me!

690
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,239
He loves Saikhim!

691
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,440
Love? So what?

692
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,960
No matter how good Tanthai is,
he's not the best choice for Saikhim!

693
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:23,920
Khim must have better than the best!

694
00:50:26,039 --> 00:50:27,320
I'm giving you two weeks.

695
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,519
Ruin Saikhim's wedding,

696
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:34,360
or she'll see these photos!

697
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,960
But Gaogla doesn't love Saikhim anymore!

698
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,280
Why would you make her go back to him?

699
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:43,480
Love?

700
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,000
Can you live on love?

701
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,960
Love between stupid kids
only exists in soap operas!

702
00:51:06,679 --> 00:51:07,519
Mr. Songseen!

703
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:12,719
I don't care if you hate me.
But why would you ruin Khim's life?

704
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,719
Are you still a father?

705
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,159
No. You have no heart!

706
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:19,639
Are you still a father?

707
00:51:19,719 --> 00:51:20,679
Calm down, miss.

708
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,840
Damn it, Mr. Songseen!

709
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:40,360
Where were you?

710
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,840
Why was your phone off?

711
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,800
Why are you here?

712
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:45,960
To talk about important things.

713
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,599
You mean last night?

714
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,199
So last night,
I went to talk about the divorce.

715
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,559
But Gaogla accused me

716
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:00,599
of killing the baby.

717
00:52:00,679 --> 00:52:02,639
Do you remember when he was in prison,

718
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:05,880
and I begged you to tell him I miscarried?

719
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:09,039
An actual divorce?

720
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,320
He said he doesn't wanna rehash things.

721
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,440
He doesn't care anymore.

722
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,599
He doesn't want to explain anymore.

723
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:19,719
No matter what you think of him,

724
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,199
he doesn't care anymore.

725
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,440
He doesn't love you now.

726
00:52:27,639 --> 00:52:28,639
I want to know

727
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:31,280
why he accused me
of asking for a divorce first.

728
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,800
Why did he accuse me of killing the baby?

729
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:38,079
He said that?

730
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:42,559
When I wrote him that letter,

731
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:45,719
I actually said I would wait for him.

732
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,800
He's the one who dumped me first.

733
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,559
You remember, right?

734
00:52:53,159 --> 00:52:55,000
Your letter never reached him.

735
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,239
What does that mean?

736
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,360
Your letter was switched out beforehand.

737
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,159
I later found out
that your dad seized your real letter.

738
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:14,119
What Gla read was a new letter
that your dad wrote.

739
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,039
What? Why didn't you tell me?

740
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:19,480
Well, I found out later

741
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:22,960
that the letter Gaogla read wasn't
the one that I brought.

742
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,119
You knew?

743
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,800
Why didn't you tell me?

744
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,039
I wanted you to get over that man!

745
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:38,679
And… when he said…
that he didn't love me anymore?

746
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,199
He didn't say that.

747
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,159
I said it so you'd get over him.

748
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:48,599
Why?

749
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:50,280
Your dad

750
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,719
would pay for me to study abroad with you

751
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,199
if I could break you two up.

752
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,960
Do you realize what you've done?

753
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:12,000
Khim, Gaogla isn't a good match for you.

754
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,840
I don't want him to ruin your future.

755
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:22,599
Are we still friends?
Why did you betray me like this?

756
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,679
Khim!

757
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,599
Don't let this man come between us!

758
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,239
Khim!

759
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:31,880
Khim?

760
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,320
-Khim?
-Khim!

761
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,360
Wait, Lita.

762
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:39,400
What's wrong with Khim?
What did you talk about?

763
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:41,719
Was it last night?

764
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:43,880
Khim!

765
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,559
Khim!

766
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,480
What's going on?

767
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,320
Why are you fighting?

768
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,880
She acts like I'm not her friend.

769
00:54:58,519 --> 00:54:59,679
Is this about last night?

770
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,360
What did she tell you?

771
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:03,800
Khim!

772
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:08,440
If she were really my friend,

773
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:10,519
she wouldn't go behind my back

774
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:12,320
or hurt me like this!

775
00:55:14,199 --> 00:55:15,360
So all this time,

776
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:17,239
she wasn't honest with me.

777
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:19,559
Khim!

778
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,840
Why did you do this, Lita?

779
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,679
Why did you tell her?

780
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,920
What do you mean?

781
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,159
About last night,
you know I'm not into you.

782
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,039
I love somebody,

783
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:30,719
and we're getting married.

784
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,639
Why did you do this?

785
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:05,519
Damn!

786
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:10,920
Make Tanthai leave Saikhim.
Then you get Tanthai.

787
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,719
It's a win-win situation!

788
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:17,599
Are we still friends?

789
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:20,039
Why did you betray me like this?

790
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,039
About last night,
you know I'm not into you.

791
00:56:28,599 --> 00:56:31,079
I love somebody,
and we're getting married.

792
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,039
I didn't think I'd see you here.

793
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:52,280
We don't know each other.

794
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,119
But I know Carl, your partner.

795
00:56:55,719 --> 00:56:56,800
Are you two friends?

796
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,159
Is "friends" the right word?

797
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,239
Let's call this a word of caution.
I don't want to see you get hurt.

798
00:57:06,679 --> 00:57:07,920
Why would I get hurt?

799
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,719
Well,

800
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:17,519
I don't want to tell you and have you
waste brain cells worrying about it.

801
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,639
But this really is kind of a big deal.

802
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:22,000
You should know.

803
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,000
It's about

804
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:25,360
Carl's ex-wife.

805
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,280
What?

806
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,880
You do know that Carl…

807
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:32,920
was married?

808
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,719
My Carl was married?

809
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,559
Well, not was.

810
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:39,719
He still is. They're not divorced yet.

811
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,400
That's impossible.

812
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,960
Why would I lie to you?

813
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:46,840
I mean well.
I don't want you to look stupid.

814
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,239
Carl's ex is a respectable lady.

815
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,360
Carl must have tricked you,

816
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,079
and you believed every word, right?

817
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:05,960
Where were you last night, Carl?

818
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,119
Did you forget our date?

819
00:58:08,199 --> 00:58:12,079
I had some business to do.
I had a conference call with America.

820
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:14,119
I stayed here. I didn't go out.

821
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:17,119
You didn't think of calling?

822
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:20,679
Why are you making it a big deal?

823
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:34,639
Whose is this? Why is it here?

824
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,599
What are you hiding?

825
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,559
Are you seeing someone else?

826
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,719
I've never seen that before.

827
00:58:41,639 --> 00:58:43,039
Is this your wife's?

828
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,360
Are you married?

829
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,800
Is this your wife's lipstick?

830
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,960
Who told you that?

831
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:51,440
Your eyes did.

832
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:53,639
How could you hide
such a big secret from me?

833
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:57,360
I haven't divorced her yet.

834
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,559
But she and I ended it long ago.

835
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,840
So whose lipstick is it?

836
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,039
So you're dating me
to sneak around behind your wife's back?

837
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:10,880
It suits you
that I fly back and forth all the time.

838
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,320
No wonder Mom warned me
to be careful with you.

839
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,199
I can't believe you tricked me.

840
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:19,039
Why are you so cruel to me?

841
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,920
Claire!

842
00:59:37,159 --> 00:59:38,760
Your mom's flying home today.

843
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,800
I think you should see her off.

844
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,719
You don't know if you'll meet again.

845
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,840
Shall we deal with everything else later?

846
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,800
I understand

847
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,719
that you and Carl have problems.

848
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:05,360
If you need my help, tell me right away.
I'm ready to do everything to help you.

849
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:10,719
What I did to him was…
even worse than this.

850
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,639
I don't know who started all this trouble.

851
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,159
But I'm here for you.

852
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:29,320
Thank you.

853
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,199
I…

854
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,440
I have no one else left.

855
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:40,719
Everyone around me,

856
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,599
I feel like

857
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:46,440
I don't know who any of them really are.

858
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:50,760
That's good.

859
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,679
You don't have to care about anyone.

860
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:56,639
Just care about your own feelings.

861
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,159
I understand now

862
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,559
why you walked out of Dad's life.

863
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,719
You're meant to love certain people,
but you're not meant to stay with them.

864
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,440
If you understand that,
when you love someone,

865
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:15,760
you won't force yourself to do things.

866
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,400
But when

867
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,480
you're not with the person you love,

868
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:21,960
it doesn't mean you have to hate them.

869
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:30,960
I feel reassured

870
01:01:32,599 --> 01:01:35,159
now that you have a good partner.

871
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,519
About last night…

872
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,280
You weren't working, right?

873
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,599
I just found out

874
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,239
that Dad forged some documents
and caused trouble for me.

875
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:48,639
And Lita knew about it.

876
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,000
Hey, did Lita admit this to you?

877
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,000
It happened a long time ago.

878
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,519
Lita said that she did it

879
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:59,599
because she wanted to study with us.

880
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,840
About last night,
you know I'm not into you.

881
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,719
I love somebody,

882
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,400
and we're getting married.

883
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,719
Why did you do this?

884
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,639
Auntie?

885
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:22,840
Are you going to the airport now?

886
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,679
Yes. Claire said she can't see me off.

887
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,119
I don't know what's wrong.
She just disappeared.

888
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,159
But when she called,

889
01:02:31,239 --> 01:02:32,679
she didn't sound so good.

890
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:33,880
I'm worried about her.

891
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,360
Please put my bags in the car.

892
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,760
Miss Claire.

893
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,079
I have an idea.

894
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:50,719
Let's get Tan to see you off,
and I'll wait here for Miss Claire.

895
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,519
I'll call you when I know more.

896
01:02:54,039 --> 01:02:54,880
Thanks.

897
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:58,440
I have to go.

898
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:00,880
Let's go.

899
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,440
I can't let Mom see me like this.

900
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,639
She'd fret and want to stay.

901
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,159
Miss Claire.

902
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,280
Is something seriously wrong?

903
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,760
Have you been tricked by a close friend

904
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,599
to the point that you

905
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:35,280
can't trust anyone at all?

906
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:38,639
Yes, I have… and every time they lie,

907
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:42,000
they all say they're doing it
because they mean well.

908
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:51,000
Carl lied.

909
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,239
He's married. He has a wife.

910
01:03:55,679 --> 01:03:57,280
They were together last night.

911
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,239
How do you know this?

912
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,599
I uncovered his lie.

913
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,880
And he said he's not divorced yet.

914
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:12,719
Really?

915
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:18,519
Mom tried to warn me so many times,
but… I didn't think it would be this bad!

916
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:21,159
He said they're not together.

917
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,760
All men always say that.

918
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,639
I'm so stupid, aren't I?

919
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:28,840
I should've known
he moved here with his wife.

920
01:04:33,159 --> 01:04:35,400
What kind of woman leaves men like him?

921
01:04:41,159 --> 01:04:43,280
I think she must be clinging onto Carl.

922
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:52,039
If you wanna say yes now, you're too late.

923
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,559
I want us to talk like adults.

924
01:05:56,639 --> 01:05:58,159
I want to know.

925
01:05:58,239 --> 01:05:59,599
If we turned back time,

926
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:02,840
would you really want us to stay together?

927
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,920
Even if all that didn't happen to us then,

928
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,039
I think we still

929
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:08,840
wouldn't have made it to today.

930
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,519
Look at you now.

931
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:12,920
If you had to trade
everything you have now

932
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,480
to become that old Gaogla again,

933
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:17,880
you'd always choose
the future that you have now.

934
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:22,679
Admit that even if we were still together,
we'd have to break up one day anyway.

935
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,760
Why are you saying this?

936
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,679
Think about it.

937
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,559
Maybe we never really loved each other.

938
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,760
We barely knew each other.

939
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:36,800
We just got involved

940
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:40,719
to look after a baby that…

941
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,199
that didn't even mean
to be born as our child.

942
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,880
Why can't we just forget it?

943
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:54,079
Wanna trade places with me?

944
01:06:55,559 --> 01:06:57,559
I had to fight to survive.

945
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:00,559
See if you can forget days like those.

946
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,840
Try living in prison.

947
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:05,559
My dad and my sister starved
to save money to help me.

948
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:08,400
I was so ashamed to face them

949
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,519
because I'd made the world despise them.

950
01:07:11,639 --> 01:07:13,440
You wanna try living my life?

951
01:07:14,039 --> 01:07:16,639
Then you'd see
why I can't forget those days.

952
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:19,480
I'm not so obsessed with you
that I can't forget you.

953
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,159
I just remember
the pain that you brought me.

954
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,119
You know what?
In my sleep, I said my murderer's name.

955
01:07:30,199 --> 01:07:31,039
Khim.

956
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,599
Even while I was dying,
I kept thinking of you

957
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,760
while you were having a good time
wherever you were then!

958
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,880
My recovery was long.

959
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:44,599
I couldn't walk or eat.

960
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:47,719
I couldn't even open my eyes!

961
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,840
For years, I saw those images
when I closed my eyes.

962
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,400
When I was awake, I couldn't tell
between reality and nightmare.

963
01:07:58,159 --> 01:07:59,639
For years now,

964
01:07:59,719 --> 01:08:02,760
I've been scared to fall asleep
and never wake up again.

965
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:04,159
Don't die, Gla!

966
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:07,280
Try living my life,
or go through half what I've been through!

967
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:12,360
I'm sorry.

968
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:13,800
I'm sorry!

969
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,680
And you dare preach to me
about letting things go?

970
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,039
I didn't know what you went through.

971
01:08:22,119 --> 01:08:23,880
Don't make that face like you pity me!

972
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:28,520
If I could choose to do anything,
I wouldn't go back to change our past.

973
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,399
But I'd make you suffer instead of me.

974
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,720
If we could trade places,

975
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:42,840
I'd do it.

976
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:45,600
Could you stand it?

977
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,439
If I'd known you were suffering so much,

978
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,119
I would've come back.

979
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,199
But back then, everyone said you died.

980
01:08:58,279 --> 01:09:01,039
-I gotta go.
-I thought you and the baby were gone.

981
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,600
And I was left to live on in pain.

982
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:05,119
Live on in pain?

983
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:09,960
You said you live on in pain?
In your beautiful, luxurious life?

984
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,319
If I could make it up to you,

985
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,039
what should I do to make you happy?

986
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:24,119
Is there still a way
for us to end this amicably?

987
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,199
You really want a divorce?

988
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,119
Give me my time back.

989
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:36,199
Give me back
the time that you spent with other men.

990
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,560
Try living and breathing as me.

991
01:09:39,319 --> 01:09:41,039
Tell me what you want me to do.

992
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,439
Before becoming someone else's wife,

993
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,800
make it up to me.

994
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,680
If I do this,

995
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,359
you'll sign the divorce papers
and let me go, right?

996
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:53,840
You have to sacrifice your time.
You have to be at my beck and call.

997
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:58,199
If you feel nothing when you're with me,
it means we're nothing to each other,

998
01:09:58,279 --> 01:09:59,560
and I'll sign the papers,

999
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,159
and you can go away,
and marry anyone you want.

1000
01:10:03,239 --> 01:10:05,359
If it's not what you asked for last night,

1001
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,800
I can do it.

1002
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:12,880
That depends on you.

1003
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:17,640
If you can resist me when you're with me,
then I don't have a problem.

1004
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,840
Tell me what to do.

1005
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:26,880
TIME BANK

1006
01:10:27,479 --> 01:10:28,439
Just tell me.

1007
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,199
From now on, you'll stay with me
and do what I ask you to do.

1008
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:37,600
Your duty is
pleasing me till I'm satisfied.

1009
01:10:39,399 --> 01:10:40,640
MAN: YOUR FLOWERS ARE HERE

1010
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,279
Start by helping me
make up with Claire today.

1011
01:10:44,439 --> 01:10:46,920
You have to fix
all the problems you caused

1012
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,880
and make Claire take me back.

1013
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:53,039
Is this little favor too much to ask?

1014
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:58,920
I came to check on you.

1015
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,720
I know that you're upset,

1016
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,920
so I had someone investigate your partner.

1017
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,159
So is it true?

1018
01:11:10,039 --> 01:11:11,399
He was married once.

1019
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:15,439
But there's something else
that you should know.

1020
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,520
He married that woman
because he got her pregnant.

1021
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:24,279
She was just a spoiled brat
who met him in a dating app.

1022
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:26,800
He agreed to marry her
to look after the baby.

1023
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,399
I heard that

1024
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:31,159
they didn't live together for long,

1025
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:34,319
and Carl had to travel for work.

1026
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:37,840
She had a miscarriage
and couldn't bear being poor,

1027
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,279
so they grew apart.

1028
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,960
Since then, they haven't seen each other.

1029
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,279
Carl went abroad.

1030
01:11:45,359 --> 01:11:47,479
He changed his whole name
when he got adopted,

1031
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,880
so they couldn't contact each other.

1032
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,960
And that's why
they never managed to get divorced.

1033
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:56,800
But he met up with his wife yesterday.

1034
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,119
They were probably arguing
about their marital property.

1035
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,680
Carl didn't tell you

1036
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:07,960
because he didn't want you
to worry about this.

1037
01:12:09,079 --> 01:12:10,439
It looks like

1038
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:14,199
they don't have such a close relationship.

1039
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:18,520
They haven't gotten divorced yet
'cause they're protecting their interests.

1040
01:12:20,119 --> 01:12:22,359
So it was because they had a baby.

1041
01:12:25,119 --> 01:12:25,960
No wonder.

1042
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,119
Is something wrong?

1043
01:12:33,079 --> 01:12:36,239
Carl told me that he made the Arsa app

1044
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:39,520
because he was inspired
while he was interning at a call center.

1045
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:44,680
A kid was left at home, and they called,
asking Gla to find their mom.

1046
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:47,680
And Carl thought
the mom must have gone to work.

1047
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,960
He wanted someone to look after the child

1048
01:12:51,479 --> 01:12:53,920
so that they wouldn't feel
alone or abandoned.

1049
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,319
Carl must have really taken
his deceased baby to heart.

1050
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,279
Carl's very sensitive about kids.

1051
01:13:04,359 --> 01:13:08,720
Whenever he sees kids,
he always helps them or protects them.

1052
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:10,920
It's like he wants

1053
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,760
to do the duties of a dad
for the kids who are still here.

1054
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,000
Can I talk to the baby?

1055
01:13:19,079 --> 01:13:20,279
Sure.

1056
01:13:22,039 --> 01:13:24,520
Hey, kid. This is your dad.

1057
01:13:25,119 --> 01:13:26,479
I'm working in the forests.

1058
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,479
It's pitch dark,
but the sky is full of stars.

1059
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,760
What's your real age?

1060
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:31,680
Seven.

1061
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,119
The same age as my child.

1062
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,039
If it had survived,

1063
01:13:36,119 --> 01:13:37,479
it would be annoying like you.

1064
01:13:39,079 --> 01:13:41,039
His heart isn't at ease

1065
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,039
because he couldn't protect his own child.

1066
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,439
You didn't think
he was such a good guy, right?

1067
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:53,680
Actually, he…

1068
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,720
he really deserves compassion.

1069
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,600
You should give him another chance.

1070
01:14:06,039 --> 01:14:07,319
He told me

1071
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:10,239
to start dating him with zero love

1072
01:14:11,239 --> 01:14:12,600
and keep loving him more

1073
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,800
instead of loving him 100% first

1074
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:19,680
because if he disappointed me,
all that love would disappear.

1075
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:22,800
I guess he knew
his wife would be an obstacle.

1076
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:29,800
But he made me love him so much,
I'm too deeply in love to back out now.

1077
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:33,159
You have to make that woman meaningless.

1078
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,199
I guess that Carl probably

1079
01:14:36,279 --> 01:14:38,680
stopped loving that woman a long time ago.

1080
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:47,760
That's true.

1081
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,680
I'm sorry I was so stupid.

1082
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:21,239
We should solve these problems together.

1083
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,159
I hope you're satisfied.

1084
01:16:00,359 --> 01:16:01,600
Here comes the food.

1085
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,359
We have all your favorites.

1086
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:07,279
I'm telling you,
the food from this place is so amazing.

1087
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:10,399
Much nicer than what you've had.

1088
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:57,399
You're meant to love certain people,
but you're not meant to stay with them.

1089
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:02,000
If you understand that,
you won't force yourself to do things

1090
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,319
when you love someone.

1091
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,760
If you're not with the person you love,

1092
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:10,359
it doesn't mean
you have to hate each other, right, honey?

1093
01:17:41,079 --> 01:17:44,479
Your brother's raising money
for the app, isn't he?

1094
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:47,880
He wants to expand the app

1095
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,560
to reach more users, that's all.

1096
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:54,079
He's not spreading his wings
outside my company with new investors?

1097
01:17:56,159 --> 01:18:00,399
We're just looking for more partners.
We haven't closed deals with anyone yet.

1098
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:04,840
Papers, ma'am.

1099
01:18:08,079 --> 01:18:09,880
Don't you dare disrespect me.

1100
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,439
Look at that old house.

1101
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:15,840
Your brother flattered the owner
and got the deed transferred in his name.

1102
01:18:16,439 --> 01:18:17,439
Doing that

1103
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,079
is basically betrayal.

1104
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,239
That plot of land

1105
01:18:21,319 --> 01:18:23,159
must belong to my company alone!

1106
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:26,920
If you betray me, I'll kick you out.

1107
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,600
If you didn't have me,
people like you guys wouldn't be here!

1108
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,880
Madam, the doctor's here
for the house call.

1109
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,800
Who wouldn't be here today without Gla?

1110
01:19:19,439 --> 01:19:21,600
How many more years
will she hold on to him?

1111
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,399
This is hurting everyone enough.

1112
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,119
Is the board here already?

1113
01:19:28,199 --> 01:19:29,159
Yes, they're here.

1114
01:19:29,239 --> 01:19:31,079
Did you hand out those documents?

1115
01:19:31,159 --> 01:19:33,760
No, I heard the meeting agenda changed.

1116
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,840
How could that be?

1117
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:36,640
Who changed it?

1118
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:44,159
I've quit politics.

1119
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:47,159
I want to come back
and manage things around here

1120
01:19:47,239 --> 01:19:49,600
because Saikhim has to prepare
for her wedding soon.

1121
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,359
She probably can't focus
on her CEO duties.

1122
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:04,880
She wants freedom.

1123
01:20:05,479 --> 01:20:07,239
She wants to live how she wants.

1124
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:08,880
I can sympathize.

1125
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:14,199
You know, a woman

1126
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,560
doesn't get to be a bride so often,

1127
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:23,119
so I want her to fully commit
to the choice she made for herself.

1128
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:27,720
I'd like to take the opportunity
to announce here in this meeting

1129
01:20:28,439 --> 01:20:29,680
that from now on,

1130
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,840
I'll manage everything here myself.

1131
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,560
Dad meant to humiliate me!

1132
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:41,439
He's angry that you didn't
finalize the divorce like he asked.

1133
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,399
He wants me to beg for Gaogla's fortune?

1134
01:20:44,479 --> 01:20:45,760
He doesn't want the money.

1135
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,359
He just wants to waste Gla's time

1136
01:20:47,439 --> 01:20:49,000
to get revenge on him.

1137
01:20:49,079 --> 01:20:51,399
Dad wants revenge
for making him lose his job?

1138
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,680
How is that fair on me?

1139
01:20:54,199 --> 01:20:56,680
Why should I fight with everyone
when Dad wants me to?

1140
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:02,439
You'd never take my side anyway.

1141
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,199
-Wait, Miss--
-Forget it.

1142
01:21:04,279 --> 01:21:06,359
You'll always choose Dad.

1143
01:21:08,319 --> 01:21:10,319
You've put up with me for long enough.

1144
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,439
Pick me up at the garage now.

1145
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:31,640
You have to sacrifice your time.
You have to be at my beck and call.

1146
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:36,399
Khim!

1147
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:37,920
Let's talk now.

1148
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:43,720
Khim, why didn't you answer my calls?

1149
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,039
Are you still angry?

1150
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:48,880
If you're still on Dad's side,
you're really not my friend.

1151
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:51,520
Why are you so angry?

1152
01:21:52,319 --> 01:21:55,119
Wait… do you regret losing that man?

1153
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:56,560
I don't regret that.

1154
01:21:57,319 --> 01:21:58,199
But I'm hurt

1155
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,960
because no one is honest with me.

1156
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:04,479
Khim!

1157
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:10,399
But I did what I did
because I really wanted the best for you.

1158
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:14,439
I don't want you
to get hurt because of him!

1159
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:18,880
You've already seen what he's really like.

1160
01:22:19,399 --> 01:22:23,279
When he got rich,
he totally forgot where he came from.

1161
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:32,119
I see.

1162
01:22:33,159 --> 01:22:34,800
Dad invited you to the meeting too?

1163
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:38,239
He must have some project
to have you look after.

1164
01:22:39,479 --> 01:22:41,359
I won't stand in the way of your success.

1165
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,800
-Where to?
-FCT Tower.

1166
01:24:12,039 --> 01:24:15,880
I like light roast coffee in the morning.
If you don't know something, ask.

1167
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,680
You have to please me. Make an effort.

1168
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:09,960
Why the long face? Just sit and breathe.

1169
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,680
The tower's right there.

1170
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,119
Would it be faster to walk?

1171
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:17,479
You think I wanna be stuck with you?

1172
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,960
Being around me seems
to make you desperate.

1173
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:48,000
What is it?

1174
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:59,239
You have to tidy the garage today.
I'm going to move in.

1175
01:25:59,319 --> 01:26:02,319
Don't let me see you.
This is awkward enough.

1176
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:06,520
You have to finish before I get back,
or I won't count the time you spent.

1177
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:20,039
Hey, so you want me to be your servant?

1178
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,520
We're husband and wife,

1179
01:26:24,279 --> 01:26:26,560
but you're cheating
with your lover all the time,

1180
01:26:27,079 --> 01:26:28,800
so I have to reclaim my rights.

1181
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:32,039
If I really filed for divorce,
you could go broke.

1182
01:26:33,359 --> 01:26:34,680
-I'll--
-Honey.

1183
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:47,520
Now your job is to make my life easier.

1184
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:52,239
I'll give you lots of stupid tasks to do.
You'll do all the unnecessary stuff,

1185
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:54,960
so I'll have time
to focus on other things.

1186
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:57,359
I don't care enough to think about you.

1187
01:26:57,439 --> 01:26:59,640
Do something useful with your time.

1188
01:27:00,479 --> 01:27:01,680
Just don't bother me.

1189
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:11,119
What's going on?

1190
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:15,560
I can't help it.

1191
01:27:17,119 --> 01:27:18,640
She has to work for that divorce.

1192
01:27:23,239 --> 01:27:25,840
Nah, you're just trying
to make her want you back.

1193
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:26,840
Mind what you say.

1194
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:28,760
I'm making sure she has no one left.

1195
01:27:34,159 --> 01:27:38,000
So Gla isn't just stalling
because he doesn't want a divorce?

1196
01:27:38,079 --> 01:27:41,039
Don't worry. Time won't make us
love each other more.

1197
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:42,680
When you're here, make an effort.

1198
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:44,359
You have to live and breathe me.

1199
01:27:44,439 --> 01:27:46,199
You see?

1200
01:27:46,279 --> 01:27:48,840
This is why I said
it'd never work out for us anyway!

1201
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:53,960
If you're over a woman,
you have to sever all ties.

1202
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:58,000
I hope Carl means what he says.

1203
01:27:58,079 --> 01:27:59,880
I don't want to be stupid anymore.

1204
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:01,880
What's wrong?

1205
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:02,800
Give me the keys!

1206
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:03,760
A car's tailing us.

1207
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:10,560
No!

1208
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:11,640
Something happened!

1209
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:12,600
What is it, Khem?

1210
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:50,079
